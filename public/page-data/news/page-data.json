foot.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>The Australian Tax Office (ATO) has now begun their recovery debt collection by sending Director Penalty Notices and Director Penalty Notice Warnings. We had seen that the ATO recently paused their debt recovery processes due to the pandemic, and it looks like they are now in pursuit of unpaid taxes. A Director Penalty Notice (DPN) is a document sent from the ATO to a director of a company. This notice is issued towards the director to inform them they may be personally liable for the tax debts of the company. A director penalty notice is issued to director(s) of a company that has defaulted on their tax obligations. A Director Penalty Notice can make the director personally liable for the companyâs tax debt set out in the notice if no action is taken. This is why it is important to act quickly by seeking professional help when you have received a Director Penalty Notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is a Director Penalty Notice (DPN)?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A Director Penalty Notice is issued to director(s) of a company that has defaulted on their tax obligations. As a director, you are responsible for ensuring the company meets its tax obligations, which includes, keeping lodgements up to date, Pay As You Go withholding, Superannuation Guarantee Charge or GST. The Director Penalty Notice outlines the director is personally liable for the penalties that are equal to the unpaid funds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What type of DPN have you received?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two types of Director Penalty Notices and deciphering the differences can be confusing. As a director you need to determine which type of Director Penalty Notice you have received from the ATO.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>21-Day Director Penalty Notice</li><li>Lockdown Director Penalty Notice</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>21-Day Director Penalty Notice</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A 21-Day Director Penalty Notice is a Director Penalty Notice that requires âactionâ within a 21-day period. The 21-Day director penalty notice is issued by the ATO when the companyâs tax liabilities have not been paid, however, <strong>have been reported to the ATO</strong> within a three-month period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have received a 21-day director penalty notice it is best to act quickly, speak to our experts today on 02 9220 7100.Â </p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Lockdown Director Penalty Notice</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lockdown Director Penalty Notice is issued when a companyâs tax debt is not paid and <strong>have not been reported</strong> to the ATO within the last three months of the due date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As soon as you receive any type of director penalty notice it is highly recommended to contact an insolvency practitioner to ensure you do not become personally liable for the companyâs debt. An insolvency practitioner can guide you to the best solution for your situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get expert advice, speak to one of our insolvency experts <a href=\"https://mackaygoodwin.com.au/contact/\">today</a>.<strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What are my options when I receive a DPN?</strong><br>Receiving a director penalty notice can be daunting, especially when you do not know what your options are. We have outlined your five possible options to a director once a director penalty notice is issued.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your possible options are:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Repay the debt in full</li><li>Enter an instalment agreement to repay the debt by entering into a non-formal agreement or payment plan</li><li>Voluntarily wind up your companyâs affairs through <a href=\"https://mackaygoodwin.com.au/liquidation/\">liquidation</a></li><li>Appoint an administrator to enter <a href=\"https://mackaygoodwin.com.au/insights/voluntary-administration/\">Voluntary Administration</a></li><li>Defend the director penalty notice</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>With each option, it is recommended you <a href=\"https://mackaygoodwin.com.au/contact/\">contact</a> an insolvency practitioner to ensure you do not fall personally liable for the debt. An insolvency practitioner will also guide you correctly through the steps to ensure you do not enter any other consequences.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter

former company who has received a Director Penalty Notice, you may still be liable for the companyâs tax obligations. It is important to know that you can still be held responsible for the debt outlined in the director penalty notice, but there is a criteria that must be followed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a former director you can be liable if the following has occurred:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The unpaid PAYG withholding, net GST or SGC liabilities were due before the date of your resignation</li><li>The tax obligations of the company fell due after your resignation when:<ul><li>The PAYG withholding, net GST or the first withholding event in the reporting period occurred before your resignation</li></ul><ul><li>The SGC liabilities date charge became payable.</li></ul></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a former director of a company that has been issued with a director penalty notice, itâs important to understand what you can and cannot be liable for. Once you are aware of the director penalty notice being issued, you should <a href=\"https://mackaygoodwin.com.au/contact/\">speak to our experts</a> straight away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What happens if I ignore a Director Penalty Notice?</strong><strong></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ignoring a director penalty notice can have serious consequences. Any form of non-compliance can result in the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>You may become personally liable for the companyâs tax debt</li><li>You can be issued with a garnishee notice</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Once receiving a director penalty notice, ignoring the notice can have serious consequences for you and your personal assets. The onus on being the director can be overwhelming, which is why we highly recommend contacting an insolvency practitioner as soon as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speak to one of our experts today, <a href=\"https://mackaygoodwin.com.au/contact/\">contact</a> us on 02 9220 7100.</p>\n","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","mediaItemUrl":"http://cms.mackaygoodwin.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/nbp-feature.jpg"}},"slug":"what-to-do-if-you-receive-a-director-penalty-notice"},{"title":"What you need to know about Director Identification Numbers","excerpt":"<p>By Andrew Quinn As a director you are now required to verify your identity as part of the new director identification number (director ID).

Following the agreement of the <em>Treasury Laws Amendment (Registries Modernisation and Other Measures) Act 2020</em> &nbsp;(Cth) all directors of a registered Australian body, registered foreign company or Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation will now be required to have a director ID (unique identifier). The director ID aids in preventing the use of fraudulent director identities and illegal phoenixing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A director ID is a 15-digit identifier given to directors once identity is verified with Australian Business Registry Services (ABRS). The director identification number will be kept forever, even if the director changes companies, stops being a director, changes name or moves interstate or overseas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) didnât verify the identity of directors, resulting in directors having multiple records with ASIC. The multiple records meant variations in information of name, address, and personal details. By creating a unique director identification number this allows for a more reliable and credible source of business information. ASIC can also trace a directors relationship to a company, meaning a director can&#8217;t disassociate themselves from an insolvent business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ABRS is now responsible for administering the director identification number. ASIC is responsible for enforcing the director ID offences as under the Corporations Act 2001 it is a criminal offence if you do not apply on time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on director ID offences, refer to ASICâs&nbsp; â<a href=\"https://asic.gov.au/for-business/running-a-company/company-officeholder-duties/director-identification-number/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">What are the director ID offences and penalties?</a>â.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Who needs to apply for a Director Identification Number</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Directors and alternate/acting directors need to apply for a director identification number. You will need to apply for a Director Identification Number if youâre an eligible officer (a director or acting in that capacity) of one of the following:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>A company of a registered Australian body or a registered foreign company under the <em>Corporations Act 2001</em> (Corporations Act)</li><li>Or, an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation that is registered under the <em>Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Act 2006</em> (CATSI Act).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>When applying for a Directory Identification Number, you must apply to verify your identity, no one can apply on your behalf.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>When should you apply for a Director Identification Number</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to recent legislation, directors are now required by law to verify their identity. Any shareholder, employee, creditor or consumer are entitled to know the name and details of the directors of a company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If youâre soon to be appointed a director of a company, you can apply before your appointment date.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For directors that fall under the Corporations Act, you must apply for your director ID by the specified dates:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If your appointment was before 31<sup>st</sup> of October 2021, you must apply by 30<sup>th</sup> of November 2022.</li><li>If your appointment is between the 1<sup>st</sup> of November 2021 â 4<sup>th</sup> of April 2022, you will need to apply within 29 days of your appointment.</li><li>If your appointment is from the 5<sup>th</sup> of April onwards, you will need to apply prior your appointment date.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>For directors that fall under the CATSI Act, you must apply for your director ID by the specified dates:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>If your appointment date was before the 31<sup>st</sup> of October 2022, you must apply by the 30<sup>th</sup> of November 2023.</li><li>If your appointment date is from the 1<sup>st</sup> of November 2022, you must apply prior date of appointment.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to apply for a Director ID</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The fastest way to apply for your Director ID is online using the myGovID app. The process is quick and involves three simple steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Set up your myGovID<br>You will need to set up your myGovID that has a strong or standard identity strength for your Director Identification Number.

permission</li><li>incorporate inappropriate tactics and language</li><li>take advantage of you due to your illness, age, ethnicity, literacy level or level of knowledge of the law and your

Itâs always important to be kind and honest to your creditors, as the outcome may be better than you think. Most lenders are more open to&nbsp;discussing your debt than you think. This is due to the fact that debt collectors buy debt per dollar, so they make a profit even if the debt isnât paid in full. This makes it important&nbsp;that you speak to your creditors as they may be flexible when it comes to settling for an amount less than your full debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10 tipsÂ on dealing with creditors</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>be honest</li><li>agree to a payment plan if you can afford it</li><li>inform the debt collector if your contact details change</li><li>reply in a timely manner</li><li>keep your story straight when discussing your finances</li><li>take notes</li><li>ask questions</li><li>always be friendly</li><li>record who said what during discussions</li><li>note down the date, time and how and who you were contacted by</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>How to deal with creditors when you canât pay</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When you know you have a debt to pay but are struggling to pay it, it can be very stressful. It is even more stressful when you donât know your options or how to speak to creditors about it.

type=\"1\"><li>Write out what you can afford<br>Once youâve been informed to repay your debt, itâs time to sit down and sort out your finances. Start by calculating your income, expenses and the remaining funds. From that you can create a budget planner.<br>If you find you are struggling with income and expenses, and cannot pay your debts, you could be trading insolvent. In this case you will need to speak to an insolvency expert as you may have to liquidate the company.<br><br>For more information on trading insolvent, refer to our article â<a href=\"https://www.mackaygoodwin.com.au/insights/a-guide-to-business-insolvency/\">A Guide to Business Insolvency</a>â.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\" start=\"2\"><li>Create a payment plan<br>As we have mentioned, speaking directly to creditors is a great approach to take. Let them know youâre facing financial distress and propose a payment plan based on the budget planner you have created on what you can afford to pay. You may be surprised to know that sometimes they will approve you to pay small amounts of funds over a period of time. The creditor may agree to close the debt if you can only pay part of the sum or even waive the debt if youâre on a low income with no assets if your financial situation will be unlikely to change.<br><br>Once you propose a payment plan, ask the debt collector to put it in writing. If the payment plan is rejected you can make a complaint to the appropriate parties below:<br><br>ACT:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.accesscanberra.act.gov.au/app/answers/detail/a_id/1598/kw/complaints\">Access Canberra</a>&nbsp;website or 13 22 81<br>NSW:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fairtrading.nsw.gov.au/help-centre/online-tools/make-a-complaint\">Fair Trading NSW</a>&nbsp;website or 13 32 20<br>Northern Territory:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://consumeraffairs.nt.gov.au/for-consumers/complaints-and-disputes\">NT Consumer Affairs</a>&nbsp;website or 1800 019 319<br>Queensland:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.qld.gov.au/law/your-rights/consumer-rights-complaints-and-scams\">Office of Fair Trading Queensland</a>&nbsp;website or 13 74 68<br>South Australia:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cbs.sa.gov.au/\">Consumer and Business Services</a>&nbsp;website or 13 18 82<br>Tasmania:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbos.tas.gov.au/topics/products-services\">Consumer Affairs and Fair Trading</a>&nbsp;website or 1300 654 499<br>Victoria:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/products-and-services\">Consumer Affairs Victoria</a>&nbsp;website or 1300 558 181<br>Western Australia:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/consumer-protection/making-complaint\">Department of Commerce</a>&nbsp;website or 1300 304 054</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\" start=\"3\"><li>Ensure you are following the payment plan<br>Make sure you are repaying your debt based on the approved payment plan.

You should always check mail from creditors, read them and act immediately. The longer you wait to deal with the creditor, the worse it can get. Once youâve read the mail, think about how you would like to deal with it. If the mail looks strange or unfamiliar, contact your creditor and ask for proof and understanding of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have outlined the top reasons why you should always check your mail from creditors:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Skipped an invoice<br>Running a business can be stressful and often things can get missed. You may have skipped an invoice and forgotten about it. This is why it is vital to check mail from your creditors before the invoice increases.</li><li>Statement of account<br>Creditors send you a statement of account which is a great tool to incorporate in your balance sheet. You may be above or below your account and not know.</li><li>Information of legal action<br>Your creditor may be closer to taking legal action and with the threat of winding up the business. Checking mail makes you aware of everything that is occurring regarding your business.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know more about dealing with creditors?

The responsibilities of a director of a company are so diverse and varied that they could be doing a handful of things at any one time. From overseeing the company&#8217;s affairs to staying up to date on the business&#8217; finances, a business director holds several key responsibilities, some you might never have known about. Here, we reveal five of those lesser-known responsibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also essential to note that directors must comply to the obligations outlined by Australian law. It is critical directors understand the obligations imposed on them as they can become personally liable for the decisions they make.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure

order.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>1. Ensures the company does not trade while insolvent</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the directorâs duty to ensure the company does not enter insolvent trading. Insolvent trading is when the company is no longer able to pay debts when they are due.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the director is aware or has reasonable grounds to suspect the company is entering into insolvency, it is their duty to act. It is best to act earlier than later as the director may become liable for the debt or ordered to pay compensation to the company and creditors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only time a director can defend the company trading insolvent is if they are ill or have reasonable grounds to expect the company was solvent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The director of the company should look out for the below signs of insolvent trading:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Decrease in cash flow</li><li>Issues with paying suppliers and creditors on time</li><li>Unable to meet repayments</li><li>Receiving legal documents from creditors, ATO or suppliers seeking funds.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>2. Oversees the affairs of a company</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The responsibilities of a director are to oversee the affairs of the company. It is the directorâs responsibility to comply within the legal obligations outlined by the Corporations Act 2001.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Directors must be up to date on the companyâs finances, managers, staff and how the business is going. The director must also take an active part in directorsâ meetings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When overseeing the affairs of the company, the director has the duty and responsibility to:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Keep informed of the performance of the company</li><li>Assess how any decision can affect the performance</li><li>Seek professional advice when you need assistance to make an informed decision</li><li>Make decisions in good faith</li><li>Disclose any personal interests you have</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the directorâs responsibility to act in the best interests of the company. Directors must act in honesty and exercise unbiased judgement when executing business decisions. Breach of this duty may result in legal action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. Keep informed about your companyâs financial position</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The role of a director in business is to be informed of the companyâs financial position. This in turn allows the director to prepare financial and director reports each financial year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the duty of the director to be&nbsp; informed of accounting and recording obligations, so seeking accounting advice is usually necessary. Being informed of the companyâs financial performance means directors must manage the assets, debts, employees, and investments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The directorsâ responsibility means they understand:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The assets owned by the company are the companyâs assets and must not be treated as your own.</li><li>They are responsible to pay debts incurred by the company.</li><li>All money invested in the company belongs to the company and must be used for the companyâs purpose.</li><li>If the company has shareholders or owners, they are entitled to take dividend payments each financial year.</li><li>The company is responsible for paying debts, it can fall on the director being personally liable if the director breaches their legal obligations.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><div data-gatsby-image-wrapper=\"\"

What does it mean?</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Many people are surprised to discover that even profitable, thriving businesses may choose to enter liquidation. But what does it actually mean when a business goes into liquidation and why would a thriving business choose this as apath?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a business is in financial trouble, it has a number of insolvency options. Whether youâre an advisor to a business in financial strife or youâre in charge of such a business, liquidation is only one possible outcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here, we break down the real meaning of liquidation, what it involves, and why a business might choose it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is liquidation?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Liquidation involves&nbsp;winding up the financial affairs&nbsp;of a company as well as selling off the assets to,if possible,fully, or partially repay debts.The process includes dismantling the companyâs structure in an orderly way. The liquidator is also tasked with investigating what might have gone wrong if the company is liquidating due to financial issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liquidation&nbsp;applies only to corporate entities&nbsp;(businesses operating under the company structure). Whereas bankruptcy â a different concept that is sometimes confused with liquidation â only applies to individuals, including sole traders and partners in partnerships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During liquidation, a liquidator is appointed to oversee the process and has full control over the companyâs operations, financial affairs, and assets. The task of the liquidator is to wind up the affairs as cost-effectively as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liquidation is the only way to wind up a company and terminate its existence. A liquidation may include a sale of business and assets as well as the transfer of employees to another company.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What does it mean when a business enters liquidation?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When a company is unable to pay its debts as and when they fall due it may be forced into liquidation by creditors. This is called an involuntary court liquidation. Thisinvolves a court procedure and a court order, made after a creditors winding up application. Alternatively, a company may liquidate voluntarilythough its directors and a majority of shareholders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With voluntary liquidation, the company may have already undertaken a voluntary administration and/or a Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA) procedure, where it is no longer viable, and creditors have chosen to wind it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the company is in liquidation, creditors cannot instigate or continue legal proceedings without permission from the liquidator and a court.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liquidation can last as long as necessary, but the process has to conform to strict rules and procedures depending on the type of liquidation it is. On average the processes can take between 3 to 6 months. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Find out more about membersâ voluntary liquidation in our comprehensive guide.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why choose liquidation?</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter size-full\"><div data-gatsby-image-wrapper=\"\"

affairs without pressure from creditors.</figcaption></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Liquidation is a suitableoptionto wind down operations of a company&nbsp;in an orderly way. It ensures assets are appropriately and legally distributed and helps minimise the impact of insolvent trading. It also gives shareholders, creditors, and directors the opportunity to have an independent expert investigate and manage the liquidation. Creditors understand that liquidation is afair and legal option foran insolvent company to deal with its financial affairs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The top three reasons why you would chooseliquidation:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Planning and Control: When liquidation is voluntary, a companyâs management is able to utilise an independent and qualified third party to minimise the financial impact on the Company and its creditors where management can be prepared for the outcomes of a planned and controlled wind up.</li><li>Lower costs: Aside from the upfront costs there is little to no cost. The registered liquidatorsâ fees are drawn from the realisation of company assets given they are sufficient.</li><li>Alleviates the stress on Company management from potential insolvent trading including reduced ongoing financial impact on employees and other creditors potentially not being paid</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Liquidation vs. Voluntary Administration</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Voluntary Administration is verydifferent from liquidation. Though liquidation is a possible outcome, voluntary administration does not necessarily always result in a liquidation. The Voluntary Administration option is an opportunityfor directors to assist and overcome a companyâs financial problems and improve normal trading. Liquidators are the only qualified parties who are able to act as Voluntary Administrators.&nbsp; A company could enter a Deed of Company Arrangement (âDOCAâ) and trading returned to the directorsâ control or be liquidated. In contrast, liquidation means the company will soon cease to exist with steps taken to wind down and or sell the business and assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While both processes involve bringing in anindependent expert to manage the process, voluntary administration opens the door to a wider range of possibilities than liquidation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on voluntary administration, read our article â<a href=\"https://www.mackaygoodwin.com.au/insights/voluntary-administration/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">What is Voluntary Administration?â</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Outcomes of Liquidation for employees</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the liquidator is appointed, steps may be taken to terminate the employment ofcompany employees. However, if the liquidator believes temporarily continuing trading and or a sale process is appropriatemay be the bestt course of action for the benefit of creditors, employees may continue in their roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employees are likely to lose their employment in the event of liquidation. Additionally, they could also lose out on entitlements if there are insufficient assets to cover the cost of the entitlements. However, employees may be able to recover outstanding entitlements (excluding superannuation) through the&nbsp;Fair Entitlements Guarantee&nbsp;(FEG). The FEG is a government scheme that lets liquidation-affected employees&nbsp;claim up to 13 weeks&nbsp;of&nbsp;unpaid entitlements&nbsp;like wages, annual leave, redundancy pay, long service leave, and payment in lieu of notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why would a successful business liquidate?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Liquidation is sometimes voluntarily entered into by a previously profitable businesses as it enables a way forward to a companyâs management to finalise the financial affairs of a corporation. This is likely where there aresignificantunmet liabilities (i.e., alitigation judgement made against the company) which has unexpectedly arisen. A Liquidation of a Companyenables the utilisation of the separate corporate veil to limit liability of the shareholders in respect to unmet liabilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a business has been built based on the services of a single person, then the stepping down of that person may require the business to be liquidated even though the business has been and or is otherwise likely to be currently viable. A liquidation also allows for commercially justified options by a Liquidator including a process of transition of an otherwise viable business operation from the insolvent company. Stakeholders including Management as well as employees and creditors generally can benefit from this option.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Are you ready to talk liquidation?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For directors and shareholders unable to fund due and payable liabilities of insolvent companies, choosing to liquidate is the best way to ensure assets are fairly distributed to creditors by an independent external expert, and in a controlled and orderly way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Mackay Goodwin, we have a team of registered liquidators to assist your business during this difficult time.

Many businesses opt for this option, and in this article, we&#8217;ll explore the various benefits involved and the steps that company&#8217;s need to take in the process. If the company is no longer serving its useful purpose or not needed, the company can enter voluntary liquidation decided by its members.

between 3-6 months to complete.Â  This is a great option for those who are wanting to quickly wind up the affairs of the business as opposed to other forms of liquidation such as creditors voluntary liquidation that can take 6-12 months to wind up the company&#8217;s affairs. Due to the short term nature of a Members&#8217; Voluntary Liquidation, this also decreases costs associated during liquidation, proving a Members&#8217; Voluntary Liquidation to be both time and cost effective.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What is the process of a Members&#8217; Voluntary Liquidation?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The process of a Members&#8217; Voluntary Liquidation is quick and short in comparison to other types of liquidation. It is the quickest method to wind up the business. This is one of the many reasons why Directors opt for this method.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>The 7 steps of a Members&#8217; Voluntary Liquidation</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>Company Wind Up: Directors agree to call a meeting of members to wind up the company.</li><li>Declaration of Solvency: Directors complete a Declaration of Solvency&#8217; which states that the company is solvent and can pay its debts within a 12-month period.</li><li>Lodgement with ASIC: The Declaration of solvency is lodged with ASIC before the formal notice of the meeting with members.</li><li>Formal Remuneration Report: The Liquidator provides members with a formal remuneration report.</li><li>Wind Up Meeting: This meeting is held to wind up all resolution of members. The members need to meet to pass several resolutions, and the meeting should end with all members in agreement that the company will be wound up, a liquidator appointed, a set amount for liquidators&#8217; remuneration is confirmed. Subject to obtaining the approval of ASIC, at this meeting the books and records of the Company and Liquidator will be disposed six months after the dissolution of the Company. In order for the Members&#8217; Voluntary Liquidation to proceed, 75% of members must vote in favour of winding up the company.</li><li>Appointment of Liquidator: A liquidator will be appointed to the Members&#8217; Voluntary Liquidation. The liquidator will then notify interested parties before finalising affairs of the company. This includes tax returns, realising assets, paying creditors, distributing surplus to shareholders.<br>The liquidator also must fulfil other obligations such as, advertising appointment, notifying the ATO and interested parties at relevant stages and providing all information of the process to members.</li><li>Final Meeting of Members&#8217; Voluntary Liquidation: Once affairs have been dealt, the liquidator will call a Final Meeting of Members, with one month&#8217;s notice. The appointed liquidator lodges a Final Return and Final Liquidator&#8217;s Account of Receipts and Payments with ASIC. The meeting can only be held after all creditors&#8217; claims are satisfied and other issues resolved, and any surplus distributed to members.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What happens at the final meeting of a Members&#8217; Voluntary Liquidation?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once all assets are realised and dividends are paid, the process ends with the liquidator calling the final meeting of a Members&#8217; Voluntary Liquidation.

The main concerns of the cohort in regard to Cyber security was the risk of losing of data, &gt;40% represented the biggest risk vector which I found personally remarkable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Itâs often banded around that data is the new oil, data is the crown jewels of an organisation and of course in the event of a breach losing that data has some significant implications for a business including loss of reputation, loss of confidence, loss of customers, and fines</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, if we overlay the recent cost of a data breach from IBM published last month we see that data breach costs rose from $3.86 million in 2020 to $4.24 million, the highest average total cost in the history of the report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, it reported data breaches that took longer than 200 days to identify and contain cost on average $4.87 million, compared to $3.61 million for breaches that took less than 200 days. Overall, it took an average of 287 days to identify and contain a data breach, seven days longer than in the previous report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the costs are going up, the risks are elevated and ransomware is at an all-time high for businesses. We also know that COVID-19 has brought about several key changes in the way we all work. Remote workers will continue to be a target for cybercriminals moving forward. We also know that the attacker is the one innovating-as businesses are merely responding to that innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, James discussed that 95% of cybersecurity breaches are caused by human error, therefore, the focus must be on enabling education and governance around Cyber Security for your business. Whilst the idea of humans being your first layer of defence is discussed all the time, itâs still true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we can uplift an individualâs awareness and skillset to spot nefarious attacks, we can lower risk for a business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what can you do today to get on the front foot and not be a statistic?&nbsp; We recommend some simple tips to be aware off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top 5 Tips to Identify a Phishing Email</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users all across the globe receive an average of 16 malicious emails every month! Additionally, with the host of email subscriptions that we consciously sign up for, a careful examination of an email before our response could be quite taxing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, awareness is key to foiling potential attempts of stealing your confidential personal or business data. Here are some tips on how to spot a phishing email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Stay Clear of any Demand of Sensitive Information via Email</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that a legitimate organisation would never demand your sensitive personal or financial information through an email. Moreover, a company that you usually deal with would rather direct you to a phone conversation for any information about your account. Beware of unsolicited emails that demand personal information and contain a link or attachment. It is definitely a scam!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Be Wary of Generic Email Salutations</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steer clear of emails (usually, marketing emails) that address you as a âvalued memberâ, âvalued customerâ, âcustomerâ or âaccount holderâ. One must avoid emails containing such generic salutations at all costs as they are usually spam emails. Remember that a genuine company would address you by your name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, some cyber conmen are avoiding the salutation part of the email altogether! So, make sure you refer to the other points in this checklist to identify if itâs malicious or genuine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Check the Domain in the Email Address of the Sender</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important tips to spot a phishing email is to closely examine the senderâs address. Check the domain in the email address i.e., the part that comes after â@â. This would give you a fair idea about the origin of the email and hence its authenticity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cybercrime masterminds often alter the spelling here and there to make the domain look legitimate. So, exercise caution! Although, this is also not a foolproof tip as companies often use unique or miscellaneous domains to reach out to their customers. In fact, small-scale companies rely on third-party email providers to send emails. So the dubious-looking domain may actually be a genuine one!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Spelling Errors Should Ring a Warning Bell</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember one thing! Every brand and every company has a team of proof-readers and copywriters. This to ensure that the content that they put out to customers is free from errors, factual and grammatical. An erroneous content, especially in an email to a potential or existing customer is a huge embarrassment for the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence, itâs obvious that an email from a valid enterprise would be well written. On the contrary, one can easily identify scam emails by their grammatical and spelling errors. Obviously, hackers are no fools either! They know their target audience and such phishing emails are mostly targeted at the lower strata of the education pyramid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Watch out for Unsolicited Attachments</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you know what the most popular bait in phishing emails is? Unsolicited and suspicious-looking attachments and links. A genuine organization never sends emails with random attachments or links. They would rather direct the user to their own website to download documents or files if required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, companies that do have your contact details may send you white papers, newsletters, etc. as an attachment. So, this isnât again a complete reliable trick although, you must be wary of attachments having .exe, .scr, and .zip extensions. The best way out is to contact the sender directly in case of any doubt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, cyber risk is divided into three main pillars. Your people, your governance, and your technology. We are here to help evaluate each of those risks to lessen the chances of an event which as you can see, prove to be expensive reputationally and fiscally</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Continuum Cyber is happy to offer your business a free Cyber assessment and discuss what steps you can take to get Cyber safe.

Meanwhile, these clients are scrambling to identify new growth pathways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, time and money that perhaps should have been spent planning for the future has been tangled up in managing the ânowâ of 2020, which continues still as directors deal with the ongoing uncertainty around how much COVID will affect the economy into 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Navigating the safe harbour</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognising that directors would need extra protections because of the COVID-19 crisis, the Federal Government introduced its emergency âsafe harbourâ legislation in March 2020, allowing directors the time to assess their companyâs position before developing further plans, either for turnaround or insolvency administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The relevant amendment, found in<a href=\"http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588gaaa.html\">&nbsp;section 588GAAA</a> of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>suspended provisions that would otherwise hold directors personally liable for trading while insolvent as a kind of <a href=\"https://aicd.companydirectors.com.au/-/media/cd2/resources/director-resources/director-tools/pdf/06547-1-director-tools-insolvency-safe-harbour-a4-9pp-web.ashx\">âdefenceâ in some circumstances</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>âAs the economy starts to recover, it will be critical that distressed businesses have the necessary flexibility to restructure or to wind down their operations in an orderly manner,â the Treasury <a href=\"https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/josh-frydenberg-2018/media-releases/extension-temporary-relief-financially-distressed\">media release</a> explained, the aim being to âhelp to prevent a further wave of failures before businesses have had the opportunity to recoverâ.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The temporary safe harbour law is just that â temporary</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally the safe harbour laws were set to expire in September 2020, but as economic impacts from the pandemic showed no signs of abating, the exemption was extended until 31 December 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What isnât made crystal clear in the legislation but is a real risk for companies, is that directors who trade on an insolvent business past the 31 December end date may be exposed to the usual insolvent trading provisions â for any period when the company was insolvent, should the company later end up in liquidation &#8211; even if that period was between March and 31 December 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The COVID-19 safe harbour protection may only apply if directors take proactive steps to appoint an external administrator or liquidator&nbsp;prior to&nbsp;31 December 2020. So, with this in mind, a prudent course of action for directors involves three steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <strong><u>Seek professional advice</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As ASIC says, â<a href=\"https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/articles/directors-duties-in-the-context-of-covid-19/\">Directors are encouraged to seek advice early</a> from a suitably qualified and independent advisor about the companyâs financial affairs and the options available to manage the disruption caused by COVID-19.â</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under current economic conditions, itâs incumbent upon directors to get your accounts and records in order and solicit expert advice â the earlier the better, for the best chance of surviving the present and thriving into the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To gain a full picture of your companyâs prospects in this uncertain trading environment directors need to embark on a full and honest evaluation of the issues facing your company, including, for example, how much youâre relying on government subsidies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to consider whether your business is still viable but perhaps suffering from&nbsp;temporary liquidity challenges that can be addressed through restructure; or in the case of an insolvency, whether the company is still feasible; or whether your business is insolvent with no viable option to save it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the right advice, directors may be able to see the COVID-19 crisis as an opportunity to transform your business and to create options when it seems like there are none: there may well be a better outcome than the appointment of a liquidator or voluntary administrator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <u style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Appoint an external administrator before 31 December, if deemed necessary<br></u></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As outlined above, safe harbour laws state that an external administrator must be appointed to your company before the moratoriumâs expiry on 31 December 2020, if the debts incurred are to be excluded from a liquidatorâs claim for insolvent trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So â&nbsp;if you are in any doubt about whether you might need to rely on the COVID-19 safe harbour protection, or if there is any risk that your company might be placed into external administration in the future, you&nbsp;mustconsider whether an appointment of a voluntary administrator or liquidator should be made on or before 31 December 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case where a company is placed into formal insolvency, directors will need advice on compliance with regulatory obligations on provision of books and information and assistance to a liquidator, administrator or controller.<br><br>3. <strong><u>Planning for the long term</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there may be a temptation to focus on the ânowâ and all its pressing needs, plans must be made for a time beyond mere survival, to recovery and beyond. Directors must use this year of profound change as a lesson in the absolute necessity for business continuity plans and corporate resilience building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Directors may need advice on lending, cashflow, restructuring, forensics, improving efficiencies to avoid financial trouble and putting together an investigative accounting report. Sound planning is best achieved through a collaborative process between you and your advisory expert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How Mackay Goodwin can help</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We follow a mantra at Mackay Goodwin: If you donât give up, we wonât either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some firms take an âInsolvency firstâ approach, Mackay Goodwin is a corporate advisory, restructuring and recovery firm with an approach that focuses on keeping businesses viable and able to trade into the future.

Every company will have some debts that must be managed on a regular basis, and good debt management is about always being aware of the debts you have and dealing with them in a timely and structured manner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With that in mind, the following are some areas company directors could focus on to effectively manage your companyâs debts, along with some debt reduction strategies you may be able to put in place if your level of debt is starting to become a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tips to manage debt</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><em>Invest in debt management software&nbsp;</em></strong>â Staying on top of your financial situation is the key to good debt management. And the best way to do this is to have good quality accounting software in place which can provide you with a snapshot of your regular payments and outstanding debts at the touch of a button. There are plenty of corporate debt management software packages on the market, and investing in the right solution now may bring a significant return on investment (ROI) in the form of future financial stability. Examples include IODM, Magiq Finance, Debtware and MomentumPro.</li><li><strong><em>Learn good accounting practices</em></strong>&nbsp;â As a company director, itâs likely you leave most accounting practices to those who are trained as an accountant â but ultimately itâs your responsibility to know enough of your books to know where your company is positioned financially. So learning the basic principles of accounting and budgeting can help you to keep your finger on the companyâs financial pulse, and could forewarn you of cash flow problems as they occur and before they become a legal issue.</li><li><strong><em>Prioritise your debt payments</em></strong>&nbsp;â One of the keys to managing debt is to prioritise payments according to their importance, and the consequences if they are not cleared in a timely manner. While payment priority would depend on your individual business, a suggested order of importance might be:</li><li><strong><em>Employees</em></strong>&nbsp;â Not paying staff on time can impact staff morale, productivity, and retention rates. As this will ultimately affect business operations, itâs essential staff are paid on a timely basis.</li><li><strong><em>Suppliers</em></strong>&nbsp;â Late payments to suppliers may erode goodwill and could negatively affect future payment terms.</li><li><strong><em>Outgoing costs</em></strong>&nbsp;â Late payment of rent or utilities may have a direct impact on business operations.</li><li><strong><em>Insurance</em></strong>&nbsp;â Late payment of public liability or professional indemnity insurance could lead to lapsed cover and the risk of financial disaster in the event of an incident.</li><li><strong><em>Cards and loans</em></strong>&nbsp;â Late payment may attract penalties and interest charges.</li><li><strong><em>Maintain good relationships with your creditors</em></strong>Protecting your companyâs credit rating is vital for your future growth, so you should do everything you can to ensure those you owe money to â such as lenders and suppliers â are paid in a timely manner. By maintaining good relationships with your creditors, it will be easier for you to negotiate favourable terms in the future or a payment plan should you find yourself unable to meet your regular repayments.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Tips to reduce debt</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you havenât been keeping on top of your companyâs finances and your debts are starting to accumulate, the key thing to do is to be proactive, rather than doing nothing and hoping for the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some suggested ways to increase your cash flow so you can pay down outstanding debts include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><em>Improve productivity</em></strong>&nbsp;â Look for ways to build efficiencies such as investing in employee training or new technology. While such initiatives involve a short-term cost, they can return a long-term benefit in the form of increased output and greater cash flow.</li><li><strong><em>Streamline accounts receivable</em></strong>&nbsp;â A great way to improve cash flow is to reduce the turnaround time between provision of service and payment. This can be achieved by re-negotiating payment terms with customers, offering incentives for early or prompt payment, and improving your debt collection processes.</li><li><strong><em>Streamline accounts payable</em></strong>&nbsp;â Just as you can offer incentives for your customers to pay you on time, you can also re-negotiate with your suppliers for more favourable terms such as 60 day payment terms or discounts for early or prompt payment.</li><li><strong><em>Optimise your inventory</em></strong>&nbsp;â Stock sitting on shelves could be costing you money, so by reviewing inventory, selling or returning slow moving lines and moving to a âjust in timeâ inventory system, you may reduce stock expenditure and free up more cash flow.</li><li><strong><em>Consolidate your loans</em></strong>&nbsp;â If you have several business loans and lines of credit, you could consider combining them into one low interest loan that will reduce the number of creditors and potentially the amount of interest you are paying.</li><li><strong><em>Cut unnecessary costs</em></strong>&nbsp;â Go through your companyâs expenditure and look for areas where cost savings could be made. This could include office supplies, cleaning services, utility providers, freight costs and marketing, to name a few.</li><li><strong><em>Prioritise payments</em></strong>&nbsp;â Rather than paying your outstanding debts according to long-term importance as described earlier, prioritise them according to how much interest you are being charged and the penalties you are receiving for late payment. This may reduce interest payments or late fee penalties.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Getting help if you need it</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business is experiencing financial distress due to overwhelming debt, you need expert advice without delay â and we can help at Mackay Goodwin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our team of specialists can work with you through the administration process to turn your company around, reduce your debt levels and bring your business back from the brink.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For a free consultation without delay anywhere in Australia, simply enter your details in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210307113550/http://www.mackaygoodwin.com.au/#contact\">online form</a>&nbsp;or call us at Mackay Goodwin on 1300 750 599.</p>\n","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","mediaItemUrl":"http://cms.mackaygoodwin.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/expertbusiness.png"}},"slug":"debt-management-tips-company-directors"},{"title":"What is Voluntary Administration?","excerpt":"<p>Voluntary administration is the process whereby a business in financial distress is assessed by an independent administrator to determine the best financial resolution for that company.

The administrator could be appointed by the company directors, the creditors of a company, or by the court.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The voluntary administrator should be a registered liquidator with ASIC, and may also be a member of professional bodies such as Chartered Accountants Australia &amp; New Zealand and the Australian Restructuring Insolvency &amp; Turnaround Association (ARITA).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The administrator will investigate the companyâs finances, review the available options, and recommend a plan to either:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Return control of the company to the directors;</li><li>Enter into a Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA); or</li><li>Liquidate the company to pay creditors.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>How does voluntary administration work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When a business enters voluntary administration, everything that has been going on until then is frozen. Creditors canât take legal action to enforce their claims against the company, owners and landlords canât recover their property, and trading is temporarily paused â meaning the companyâs directors canât be held liable for trading whilst insolvent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voluntary administration involves strict procedures and time limits that must be adhered to by the voluntary administrator. Once appointed, he/she must ensure that the following actions take place:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong><em>First meeting of creditors</em></strong>&nbsp;â This must be held within 8 business days, and at least 5 business dayâs notice must be provided to creditors. At this meeting, creditors can vote to replace the administrator (which is unlikely) and whether they want to create a committee of inspection to liaise with the administrator and keep the creditors up to date with progress.</li><li><strong><em>Administrator investigation</em></strong>â An investigation of the companyâs affairs is then undertaken by the voluntary administrator and a report prepared for the creditors on the alternatives available. The administrator will review financial records, documents and other information, and weigh up the companyâs future operating prospects in light of the interests of the creditors.</li><li><strong><em>Second meeting of creditors</em></strong>&nbsp;â This must be held within 25 or 30 business days of the administratorâs appointment, and at least 5 business dayâs notice must be provided to creditors. Based on the administratorâs report, creditors can vote at this meeting whether to return control to the directors, accept a Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA), or place the company in liquidation (in which case the administrator immediately becomes the liquidator).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"doca\">What is a Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA)?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A Deed of Company Arrangement is essentially a deal that is offered to the creditors. Its purpose is to maximise the chances of the company continuing to operate, or alternatively to provide a better return for creditors than they would otherwise receive if the company was immediately liquidated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The kinds of proposals in a DOCA can be flexible and will depend on the particular circumstances of the company. A typical proposal might provide for the company to continue trading and pay off all or part of its debts over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whatever the proposal, the DOCA must contain the following information:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The name of the Deed Administrator (can be the voluntary administrator or someone else appointed by the creditors and directors)</li><li>The property that will be used to pay the creditors</li><li>The debts that are covered by the deed and to what extent</li><li>The order in which the funds will be paid to the creditors (employees usually have priority)</li><li>The details of any suspension of rights against the company</li><li>The conditions for the deed to begin, continue and cease operation.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The success of a Deed of Company Arrangement depends entirely on the creditors belief that it is in their best interests, and it must be approved by at least 50% of creditors at the second and final meeting. If they vote in favour of the DOCA, the company must sign it within 15 days, after which the deed administration process commences.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the benefits of voluntary administration?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Voluntary administration can provide several important benefits to a company in financial trouble.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>It can unearth valuable insights during the administratorâs investigations that could help the company continue trading under a DOCA and return to profitability with the cooperation of its creditors.</li><li>It can provide a breathing space for company directors and protect them from the risk of trading whilst insolvent (a crime for which they can be held personally liable).</li><li>It can be a chance for the company to negotiate with creditors and work with them to find an amicable solution, instead of automatically responding to demands for payment.</li><li>It can give creditors a better chance of recouping some or all of their losses, something which might not happen if immediate liquidation were to occur.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Voluntary administrations are not always successful, and this can be because they are sometimes recommended when a company is beyond the recovery point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if expert advice is sought in a timely manner and the right voluntary administrator is appointed, the results can be markedly different. For example, 80% of companies who have entered into voluntary administration with<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210307105610/http://www.mackaygoodwin.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Mackay Goodwin</a>&nbsp;in the past two years have succeeded with a Deed Of Company Arrangement (DOCA).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To find out more, contact us for a free consultation anywhere in Australia by filling in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210307105610/http://www.mackaygoodwin.com.au/#contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">online form</a>, or calling Mackay Goodwin on 1300 750 599.</p>\n","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","mediaItemUrl":"http://cms.mackaygoodwin.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/What-is-Voluntary-Administration-1.jpeg"}},"slug":"voluntary-administration"},{"title":"How to Conduct a Successful Business Restructure","excerpt":"<p>Changing market conditions, shifting consumer trends, and increased competition can all impact your businessâs operating environment and make restructuring necessary. </p>\n","content":"\n<p>Changing market conditions, shifting consumer trends, and increased competition can all impact your businessâs operating environment and make restructuring necessary.

When done right, a business restructure makes your business more dynamic and innovative by reorienting it to the market. Above all, it can improve your businessâs profitability. Use the following strategies to guide you as you carefully plan your business restructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Avoid waiting too long</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A common mistake&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210307103624/https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/how-to-make-restructuring-work-for-your-company\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">is waiting too long to restructure</a>, even through the signs of trouble are there. Delaying restructuring not only reduces the options available to your business but it can also raise the risk of business failure. By acting quickly, you might be able to avoid drastic actions and end up creating more impact and value from the restructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Conduct an honest assessment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210307103624/https://australiandebtsolvers.com.au/research-centre/guide-business-restructure-turnaround-struggling-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Successful restructures are based on accurate assessments</a>, so take the time to identify whatâs happening in your business. Your business might be overleveraged or it could be experiencing poor customer retention. You might be finding it a challenge to achieve profitability targets with low margins. Accurate financial statements are the best tool for determining whatâs happening in your business and whatâs causing your financial distress. Once you have an accurate assessment, you can refine your strategy and create a turnaround plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Review your strategy and business model</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Strategic planning should inform your restructuring plan. If your business is experiencing serious challenges, your strategy and business model could be the reason. Are your products still serving your demographic, or have market preferences shifted? Is the low-margin, high-volume business model still right for you? Are you operating in an area with increased competition? Review and update your strategy and business model so you can align your restructuring plan to a new strategy that gives your business the best chance of success.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Look for ways to achieve quick results</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business is in serious trouble, look for opportunities to increase sales and revenue immediately. You can continue working on medium and longer term plans, such as changing your product or service offerings, but identify ways to boost income right away. Ceasing unprofitable product lines, liquidating unused equipment, and negotiating with suppliers are easy ways to generate quick revenue boost.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Aim to reduce complexity</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Look to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210307103624/http://www.bevingtongroup.com/the-7-principles-for-a-successful-restructure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">streamline your operations and structure as you implement your restructure</a>. Complexity in your business, such as in your order processing, managersâ roles and responsibilities, or rules and levels of authorisation. can hinder performance and must be eliminated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. Determine your core activities and processes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business restructure involves restructuring roles, firstly identify the core activities in your business as you plan your turnaround. Removing duplication is vital, but youâll want to preserve the key activities. By familiarising yourself with the top value-adding activities and the core processes, youâll ensure no critical roles are eliminated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7. Realistically assess workloads</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Role restructures can result in overloading positions, so be realistic when youâre assessing and planning your personnel restructure. With a realistic assessment, you can avoid âheavyâ or âlightâ roles and maximise productivity and performance in your team.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8. Match leaders with specific tasks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your senior and line managers could be critical partners during restructuring, since they deal with your team directly. They can be drivers or they could end up slowing down progress. One thing you can do to support your leaders is to avoid overburdening them. If you give them time to focus on leadership tasks, theyâll have more time for coaching, mentoring, guiding, and engaging with staff members to support a successful restructuring.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>9. Manage uncertainty and resistance</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Proactively manage uncertainty and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210307103624/https://expert360.com/blog/process-of-organisational-restructuring/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">resistance in your team through regular communication</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210307103624/http://www.bevingtongroup.com/the-7-principles-for-a-successful-restructure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Clarify roles, activities, and tasks</a>&nbsp;from the beginning and anticipate resistance from specific teams, departments, or team members. If you act proactively to reduce resistance, you can pave the way for a less stressful restructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>10. Stay flexible</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay flexible during the restructure. Whether itâs realising elements of your restructuring plan could be updated as you implement and learn, or recognising your staff capacity could be further reduced,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20210307103624/https://www.pivotdesk.com/blog/fearless-confessions-how-to-approach-company-restructuring/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">avoid being locked into the mindset of a perfect organisation</a>. Instead, approach it as if you only need to build a business that will be successful for the next 6 or 12 months. This way, you can stay flexible and responsive to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>11.

Whether youâre an advisor to a business in financial strife or youâre in charge of such a business, liquidation is one possible outcome. However, many people are surprised to discover that even profitable, thriving businesses may choose to enter liquidation. But why would they?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Weâve broken down what is business liquidation, what it involves, and why you might choose it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is liquidation?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Liquidation involves&nbsp;<a href=\"https://australiandebtsolvers.com.au/research-centre/a-guide-to-liquidation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">winding up the financial affairs</a>&nbsp;of a company as well as selling off the businessâs assets to repay its debts. It includes dismantling the companyâs structure in an orderly way. The liquidator is also tasked with investigating what might have gone wrong with the business if the company is liquidating due to financial issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liquidation&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.business.gov.au/closing/bankruptcy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">applies only to companies</a>&nbsp;(businesses operating under the company structure). Bankruptcy â a different concept thatâs sometimes confused with liquidation â only applies to individuals, including sole traders and partners in partnerships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During liquidation, a liquidator is appointed to oversee the process and the liquidator has full control over the companyâs operations, financial affairs and assets. The task of the liquidator is to wind up the affairs and cease trading as cost-effectively as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liquidation is different to selling a business, which only involves a change of ownership. Liquidation is the only way to wind up a company and terminate its existence. Once a company is liquidated, it is completely dissolved and permanently ceases operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The liquidation process</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Liquidation may occur when a business is unable to pay its debts. This is called involuntary liquidation. Usually this involves a court order, made after an application by a creditor, though directors or a majority of shareholders can also apply to the court.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, businesses might choose to liquidate if they want to stop operating for insolvency or other reasons. This is known as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://australiandebtsolvers.com.au/research-centre/a-guide-to-liquidation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">voluntary liquidation</a>, and itâs decided by a membersâ or creditorsâ resolution. With voluntary liquidation, the company might have already gone through voluntary administration and/or a Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA), and have since decided that the business is no longer viable and so chosen to wind it up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the company is in liquidation, unsecured creditors cannot continue or start legal action unless they have permission from a court. Directors no longer have authority, and the companyâs bank accounts are frozen. Any trading that continues is at the discretion of the liquidator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liquidation can last as long as necessary, but the process has to conform to strict rules and procedures depending on the type of liquidation it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why choose liquidation?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Liquidation is theonly way to wind down operations and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://australiandebtsolvers.com.au/research-centre/a-guide-to-liquidation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">shut down a business</a>&nbsp;in an orderly way. It ensures assets are distributed among creditors, and helps minimise the impact of insolvent trading. It also gives shareholders, creditors and directors the opportunity to have an independent expert investigate and manage the liquidation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the top reasons include control, lower costs, and freedom from the stress of insolvent trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Liquidation vs. voluntary administration</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Voluntary administration is very different from liquidation. Though liquidation is a possible outcome, voluntary administration wonât necessarily result in business liquidation. Itâs a chance for directors to appoint an external administrator to possibly help overcome the businessâs financial problems and return to normal trading. The business could enter a DOCA, return to the directorsâ control, or be liquidated. In contrast, liquidation means the company will soon cease to exist with no chance of returning to trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While both processes involve bringing in an expert to manage the business, voluntary administration opens the door to a wider range of possibilities than liquidation, which always results in the company shutting down.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Outcomes of liquidation for employees</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the liquidator is appointed, the companyâs directors lose all legal authority and the liquidator could decide to terminate all employees. However, if the liquidator believes temporarily continuing trading is the best course of action, employees could continue in their roles or be rehired. This typically happens if the liquidator intends to sell the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Employees are likely to lose their jobs in the event of liquidation. Additionally, they could also lose out on entitlements if there are insufficient assets to cover the cost of the entitlements. However, employees could recover some of this through the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jobs.gov.au/fair-entitlements-guarantee-feg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Fair Entitlements Guarantee</a>&nbsp;(FEG). The FEG is a government scheme that lets liquidation-affected employees&nbsp;<a href=\"https://australiandebtsolvers.com.au/research-centre/a-guide-to-liquidation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">claim up to 13 weeks</a>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fairwork.gov.au/ending-employment/bankruptcy-and-liquidation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">unpaid entitlements</a>&nbsp;like wages, annual leave, redundancy pay, long service leave, and payment in lieu of notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why would a successful business liquidate?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liquidation is sometimes voluntarily entered into by profitable businesses as itâs the only way to shut down operations, and if the owner does not or cannot sell the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, if a business has been built based on the services of a single person, then the stepping down of that person may require the business to be liquidated even though the business is currently viable. Another scenario may be if there has been an attempted âhostile takeoverâ of a successful business, then in order to prevent the business from being taken away from them then the owners may choose to liquidate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Are you ready to talk liquidation?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For struggling businesses, choosing to liquidate is the best way to ensure assets are fairly distributed to creditors by an external expert, and in an orderly way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Mackay Goodwin, we have a team of certified and experienced liquidators to assist your business during this difficult time.

While both could involve insolvency â the inability to meet debt obligations â theyâre not interchangeable terms. Here, we explore the key differences you should know about between liquidation and bankruptcy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is liquidation?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In Australia, liquidation is an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://australiandebtsolvers.com.au/research-centre/a-guide-to-liquidation/\">insolvency process</a>&nbsp;available only to companies. It commonly occurs if the company&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fairwork.gov.au/ending-employment/bankruptcy-and-liquidation\">canât pay its debts</a>&nbsp;or if the members want to cease operating. When a company goes into liquidation, an external expert, the liquidator, is appointed. The liquidator will wind up the companyâs financial affairs and dismantle the companyâs structure in an orderly way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The liquidatorâs role also includes taking over from the company directors and investigating the companyâs affairs to work out what went wrong. He or she will sell off the companyâs assets in order to pay off the businessâs debts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liquidation can be voluntary or involuntary. Voluntary liquidation usually happens after a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://australiandebtsolvers.com.au/research-centre/a-guide-to-liquidation/\">resolution by members or creditors</a>, who can vote for the liquidation after the company has gone into voluntary administration and/or when a Deed of Company Arrangement is terminated. Liquidation can also be initiated by the companyâs shareholders deciding to liquidate the company. Involuntary liquidation, on the other hand, usually happens by court order.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Liquidation is the only way to completely wind up a company and shut it down. For the business, it typically means the company directors cease all control, employees are terminated and bank accounts are frozen. The liquidator will then try to wind up the company as cost-effectively as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is bankruptcy?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In Australia, bankruptcy could be described as the equivalent insolvency process for individuals. When youâre declared bankrupt, youâre considered by law to be unable to pay your debts. A declaration of bankruptcy could eliminate most of your debts, especially unsecured debts, and mean debt collectors leave you alone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bankruptcy is a legal state lasting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.business.gov.au/closing/bankruptcy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">three years</a>. While it can help stop creditors and debt collectors, it can have certain implications for your financial future so should be considered an option of last resort. For example, youâll have a bankruptcy trustee appointed to manage your bankruptcy. He or she has the power to sell certain assets, including your house and property. You might need to make&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.afsa.gov.au/insolvency/i-cant-pay-my-debts/what-are-consequences-bankruptcy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">compulsory repayments</a>&nbsp;if you earn over a certain amount during this period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, youâll need your trusteeâs permission to travel overseas, and your name will be permanently listed on the National Personal Insolvency Index (NPII), a public register. Bankrupt individuals are disqualified from managing or directing companies. Finally, bankruptcy could impact your ability to get loans approved in the future as it stays on your credit report for up to seven years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could try negotiating with your creditors and getting advice from financial experts instead of considering bankruptcy straight away. However in some cases, your creditors take you to court and have you declared bankrupt.&nbsp;<strong>So bankruptcy can be voluntary or involuntary.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bankruptcy never applies to companies, but if youâre operating a business as a partnership or sole trader, you could become bankrupt. Again, this happens at the individual level only and your business isnât considered to be bankrupt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Key differences between liquidation and bankruptcy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important distinction between liquidation and bankruptcy is that liquidation is for companies and bankruptcy is for individuals.&nbsp;Bankruptcy is a legal state where an individual is declared insolvent, with certain legal consequences, while liquidation is a means or tool to shut down a company in an orderly way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While bankruptcy status remains on a public record (the NPII) forever, itâs not a permanent state of affairs as it lasts only&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.business.gov.au/closing/bankruptcy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">three years</a>. In contrast, liquidation leads to a permanent outcome: itâs the âend of the roadâ for a company as assets are sold off and the company structure dismantled with no possibility of returning to operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bankruptcy concerns an individual and his or her creditors whilst liquidation can impact more parties. Directors, shareholders, creditors, and employees could be impacted by a company going into liquidation, whether itâs through termination of employment, recovering debt, or not successfully recovering debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bankruptcy usually happens due to insolvency, but companies that enter liquidation could do so because of insolvency or some other reason. A solvent company can choose to liquidate because its members choose to stop operating, or for some other reason. Both liquidation and bankruptcy can be involuntary or voluntary, and both concepts involve managing assets and paying debt where possible, and both are options of last resort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bankruptcy and liquidation are sometimes confused with each other, but theyâre distinct concepts. The key difference to note is bankruptcy is available only to individuals, whilst liquidation is an option only available to companies. Both are likely to arise because of insolvency or inability to meet debt obligations, but solvent companies sometimes choose to liquidate for other reasons. Finally, bankruptcy is an interim, not permanent state, but liquidation leads to a permanent winding down of a company.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Are you ready to liquidate your business?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If youâve made the decision to liquidate your business, or youâre worried about your businessâ future, the next step is to speak with an expert for advice tailored to your situation.

And just as itâs important to start fresh personally, itâs also important to refresh your business. This could give your business the best possible start for the new year, and help you better manage everything from cash flow to debt obligations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get to know some of the strategies â both minor and major â you can put in action today to start the new year with a clean financial slate for your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why start the new year with a clean slate?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the holiday celebrations and the parties often thrown at the end of the year, itâs all too easy for businesses â like individuals â to fall short or fall behind on invoices, bills, and debt obligations, not to mention other processes like operations and customer service.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/outsmart-2016/seven-steps-to-start-2016-with-a-clean-slate/\">Research suggests</a>&nbsp;the December holiday period is one of the busiest times for around half of Australian SMEs, and come January, some of us might still feel like weâre in holiday mode although itâs a vital time to get on track quickly and start off the new year right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the start of the year could be a great time to declutter, reset your strategy, and create a clean slate before commencing with this yearâs strategies. By taking advantage of this time, you could get ahead of competitors and ensure your business doesnât fall behind on things like debt obligations and cash flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What you need to do to start with a clean slate</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From planning and budgeting to cash flow and major steps like insolvency processes, you can set the right foundation for a more successful year for your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1. Get started early</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While many businesses are on holiday during the December/January period, you can take the opportunity to<a href=\"https://timemanagementninja.com/2015/01/9-tips-to-help-you-start-the-new-year-with-a-clean-slate/\">&nbsp;get a headstart</a>&nbsp;on competitors. Before your clients and customers begin catching up with you in February, use January as the time to get rid of your 2017 backlog, set new goals, and<a href=\"https://www.myob.com/au/blog/10-things-set-great-start-new-financial-year/\">&nbsp;work out specific action steps</a>&nbsp;such as monthly actions to get your business on track. This could include updating operations processes and other processes in your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. Refresh your budget</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Take the opportunity to refresh your budget for the coming year once youâve balanced your books and ensure your records are up to date. Also take this quiet time as an opportunity to explore technology tools like apps and software that could help streamline budgeting and record keeping in your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. Address cash flow and chase up debt</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Research suggests businesses are owed more than $13,000 at any one time, and this is a lot of cash to be short on.&nbsp;Cash flow is the lifeblood of your business, so this is an opportunity to chase up unpaid debts and get your cash flow strategy in order. Address these unpaid debts by reminding customers to pay and escalating debt collection if necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could also consider arranging working capital if it could help your business start off the new year on a solid foundation. Take time to review how your financial outcomes were last year and identify any courses of action you could pursue to boost cash flow in the coming year. These action steps could include anything from upgrading invoicing processes to obtaining debtor financing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4. Sort out taxes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>January means youâre halfway through the financial year, and this milestone is an excellent point to check youâre organised as far as your taxes go and keeping up to date with reporting and any relevant payments to the ATO.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>5. Declutter</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Decluttering can be a powerful way to prepare for the new year by clearing away old processes, paperwork, and other clutter no longer serving your businessâs needs. By clearing away the old, youâll make way for the new â which could be a profitable, busy new year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Declutter your workplace, goals, emails, work habits, and work rituals. Declutter and refresh your business website. Decluttering might even involve reviewing your obligations in the past year and considering whether you should be saying no more often in the coming year. Take advantage of every opportunity to clear away the old and refresh your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>6. Voluntary administration</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business is experiencing serious insolvency, cash flow, or debt issues,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mackaygoodwin.com.au/insights/what-is-voluntary-administration/\">voluntary administration</a>&nbsp;could be a course of action to help you reset for the new year. This involves bringing in an independent administrator to review your business and recommend the best financial resolution for your company. Whether the outcome is liquidation, a deed of company arrangement, or return to trading, the time-out can give your troubled business much needed breathing space from most creditors and help you create a clean slate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>7. Business restructuring/turnaround</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, you could consider<a href=\"https://www.mackaygoodwin.com.au/insights/10-signs-business-needs-restructured/\">&nbsp;business restructuring or turnaround services</a>&nbsp;if youâre experiencing significant challenges in your business. Revenue drops, low competitiveness, stagnating growth, and cash-flow problems are some of the indicators restructuring or turnaround could help. With this type of expert advice, you could start the new year with a clean slate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Donât let another year pass before taking action</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Get started on giving your business a clean slate for the new year by reviewing your goals, defining action steps, and getting everything from budgets to cash flow in order. Make sure you sort out your taxes and take measures to declutter everything. If you have more serious issues, it could be a good idea to look into voluntary administration or restructuring/turnaround advice for your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes a fresh financial start requires more extreme action than simply changing up a daily habit â such as entering into voluntary administration, or restructuring your organisation.

Itâs designed to help companies, with the help of an external, independent expert, to resolve their insolvency problems quickly by deciding on the best course of action. Since voluntary administration can serve the interests of not only creditors but other stakeholders like directors, itâs useful to understand the top reasons to consider entering it, if your company is in trouble.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What is voluntary administration?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mackaygoodwin.com.au/insights/what-is-voluntary-administration/\">voluntary administration process</a>&nbsp;is an insolvency procedure giving distressed companies breathing space from creditors and a chance to restructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this period of approximately one month, an independent administrator takes control of the company. The administrator secures the assets and assesses the business to provide a recommendation to creditors on the best course of action. The creditors could choose between liquidating the company, executing a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mackaygoodwin.com.au/faqs.php#headingEighteen\">Deed of Company Arrangement</a>&nbsp;(DOCA), or returning control to directors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Why would you enter voluntary administration?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>1. To avoid trading while insolvent</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Directors are legally required to take measures to avoid insolvent trading (severe consequences can result if they donât), and voluntary administration is often used by troubled businesses to avoid insolvent trading. By initiating this process, the company and its directors can raise the defence that the directors took steps to avoid insolvent trading by appointing an administrator and avoiding incurring further debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>2. To resolve creditor issues</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Voluntary administration not only helps companies in strife<a href=\"https://australiandebtsolvers.com.au/research-centre/comprehensive-guide-voluntary-administration/\">&nbsp;hit the pause button on creditor demands</a>. It also gives them a chance to bring in an independent expert â the administrator. The external administrator examines the companyâs operations and assets to recommend the best step for resolving the situation in favour of creditors. The company can focus on resolving problems, including creditor issues, instead of constantly reacting to creditor actions, market conditions, and other factors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similarly, creditors will have a chance to review whatâs happening in the business with the administratorâs reports. Theyâll have a chance to find out the details and vote on the administratorâs recommendation, whether thatâs a DOCA, liquidation, or returning to trading under the directors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>3. To attempt to enter a Deed of Company Arrangement</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One aim of the voluntary administration regime was to allow otherwise viable businesses to have a chance to restructure and survive. Another is to administer the companyâs affairs in a way that would lead to better outcomes for creditors&nbsp;than if the company had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/insolvency/insolvency-for-creditors/voluntary-administration-a-guide-for-creditors/\">immediately entered liquidation</a>. The short break from creditor demands and most actions to recover debt gives the company to access expert advice (from the administrator) and possibly enter a DOCA.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DOCA is one of the three main possible outcomes of voluntary administration. Itâs a highly flexible arrangement thatâs effectively a compromise of the companyâs debts. Through the DOCA, the company will pay all or part of its debts and then be free of these debts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A DOCA can incorporate different arrangements, including payment of a lump sum to pay all debts due, instalment payments, and/or sale of assets and payment of proceeds. The DOCA could also include return to trading and paying instalments from profits or lump sum from final sale, or relisting the company on the ASX.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The DOCA binds all unsecured creditors even if they voted against it. However, it doesnât prevent creditors with personal guarantees from the companyâs director or another person taking action, in relation to the personal guarantee, to have their debt repaid.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>4. To protect directors from a director penalty notice</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies with cash flow and insolvency issues could be falling behind on their ATO-related compliance. For example, they could have<a href=\"https://www.ato.gov.au/Business/Your-workers/In-detail/Director-penalty-regime/?=redirected\">&nbsp;outstanding PAYG tax and superannuation liabilities</a>. In this case, the ATO has the discretion to pursue directors personally for this unpaid PAYG tax and superannuation<a href=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/business-advice/legal/director-penalty-notice-mean-business/\">&nbsp;through director penalty notices</a>&nbsp;(DPN).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, putting the company into voluntary administration would help help if the DPN relates to sums reported but unpaid to the ATO within three months of the end of the reporting period.&nbsp;If the amounts owing are both unreported and unpaid for over three months, voluntary administration will not help the director reduce the risk of personal liability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>5. To prevent liquidation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Although liquidation is a possible outcome of voluntary administration, the voluntary administration process gives the company a chance to assess whether other options could be viable before creditors vote for liquidation upon the administratorâs recommendation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The goal of voluntary administration is to provide the best outcome for creditors, so if either a DOCA or returning the company to the directorsâ control is more desirable than liquidation, the voluntary administration process gives the company an opportunity to avoid liquidation for now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Moving into voluntary administration</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Voluntary administration can be an essential process for companies in financial trouble and/or at risk of insolvent trading. It can help directors fulfil their duty to avoid trading while insolvent and it can help companies find the best solution for creditors. It also lets the company take a time-out to consider whether options like a DOCA could be the best next step. Finally, it can also protect directors from DPNs and help companies avoid liquidation, at least for the time being.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business is experiencing financial difficulties, but youâre not ready to give up, consider entering voluntary administration and turning your company around.

Company bankruptcy is often no oneâs fault in particular, but it can be crushing to everyone involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In many cases, a company that does have to liquidate could have turned things around if it identified early enough that it was running into problems, hired a business turnaround specialist or entered&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mackaygoodwin.com.au/faqs.php#heading1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">voluntary administration</a>, and adopted some simple strategies to steady the financial boat and give the company some time to turn things around.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What causes company bankruptcy?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a couple of common causes that can result in a company being rendered bankrupt. These include:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Poor bookkeeping (or even no bookkeeping)</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Smaller businesses sometimes have owners and managers that might have great ideas for a business, but arenât great at keeping records of their company finances. This isnât just a problem come tax time, but it can also mean that the business canât keep track of revenue and expenses, leading to the business spending more than the owner realised, or failing to notice a downturn in sales until it was too late.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Overspending</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A business will often bring on new people or try and expand what itâs doing with new products or services. When times are good, thereâs plenty of spare cash to make these investments, but if times tighten up, the additional expenditure can quickly eat into profitability and absorb the cash reserves.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Too great of an appetite for risk</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This often takes the form of the organisation being too willing to take on debt, particularly in the growth stages, before itâs fully aware of its revenue ceilings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Practical tips for avoiding business liquidation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If youâre facing down a potential company bankruptcy or liquidation, there are still things that you can do to steady the ship, if not turn things around entirely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>1) Have the right priorities with debt repayments</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You should look to prioritise secured debt, such as loans secured against business equipment first. The consequence for defaulting on this debt is the loss of the equipment, which is another blow to the business. Paying off high interest debts first is another critical priority, as thatâs going to accumulate faster if not paid off quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>2) Eliminate unnecessary expenses</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like you might improve your household budget by cutting back on some luxuries, youâd be surprised how much can be trimmed back from the office expenses. Do you really need to subscribe to newspapers in the era of digital media? And do you need to subscribe to every digital media source, when thereâs so many high quality news outlets that are free? Itâs nice to buy each staff member a coffee in the morning, but is the morale boost really worth the hit to the balance sheet (hint: buying a Nespresso machine for the office is much cheaper in the long run).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>3) Boost your short term cash flow</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It can be a pain chasing invoices, but calling in what youâre owed is critical to cash a flow. See if you can also pare back terms so that customers or clients are paying more quickly. On the flip side, negotiate with your lenders to see about getting term extensions for repayments. That way youâll have more cash coming in, and fewer repayments due imminently, and that will give you some more money to start dealing with the most pressing debts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>4) Consider being more flexible with your recruitment</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are advantages to having staff on full-time (they tend to be more loyal to the organisation, and are more invested in seeing it succeed), but full-time employees are difficult to dislodge, and bring with them a host of other obligations that are expensive to the business. Furthermore, if thereâs a downturn in work, youâll be paying for staff that arenât doing much. Having part-time or casual employees allows you to be more flexible with your headcount, and helps reduce business cost in lean times. The best solution is to work out what staff are core to the business, and bring them on full-time, while filling out supplemental or support roles on a casual basis.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>5) Have a âgarage saleâ</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are any equipment or assets that are underutilised, or not utilised at all, consider selling them to boost the short term cash position. Have you got a company car that is used once per week for getting someone to a meeting? Setting up a company Uber or Taxi account is going to be much cheaper. Donât just toss old computer equipment, but sell it for a bit of extra cash (making sure the hard drive is properly wiped of sensitive data, of course!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, make sure you have a turnaround management specialist you can trust. Theyâre not going to be your best friend, since saving a business from bankruptcy can mean some very hard choices at times, but that specialist will be able to provide you with sound and dispassionate advice that will help you turn your hard work into a successful business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contact Mackay Goodwin&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mackaygoodwin.com.au/#contact\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">online</a>&nbsp;or on 1300 750 599 today to start discussing your options for your business and itâs turnaround.</p>\n","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","mediaItemUrl":"http://cms.mackaygoodwin.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Bankruptcy-or-Liquidation-1.jpeg"}},"slug":"avoid-company-bankruptcy-liquidation"},{"title":"Mackay Goodwin Announces New Advisory Department","excerpt":"<p>We are thrilled to announce the latest addition of corporate advisory to Mackay Goodwin.

For ICT businesses, the world is your oyster right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For SME businesses, which may have previously struggled to compete against larger organisations for contracts, there is a unique opportunity to grow your business to meet demand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Government has simplified its process for ICT sellers to tender for contracts for digital products and services with the creation and capability expansion of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dta.gov.au/about-us\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Digital Transformation Agency</a>&nbsp;(DTA). The DTA provides strategic leadership on whole-of-government and shared ICT and digital services, including sourcing and capability development. It also oversees ICT and digital investments, assurance policy and framework, and the whole-of-government digital portfolio.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until recently, small businesses were less inclined to tender for projects because of the Governmentâs onerous payment terms, which impacted cash flow. But since the end of 2019 Federal Government introduced a policy where businesses billing for less than $1 million were entitled to claim interest if they were not paid within five days. It strongly encouraged the states to follow suit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The NSW Government has introduced faster payment terms for eligible small business suppliers â undertaking to pay them within five days (instead of 20).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Victoria, the State Governmentâs payment terms are ten business days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Queensland, payment terms are 20 business days for small businesses, with interest payable on late payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In WA, the payment terms are 20 days for invoices under $1 million, including works and construction contracts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Government has also made it much easier to tender with federal and state-based pre-approval processes modified for smaller businesses. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://marketplace1.zendesk.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360000666496\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Digital Marketplace</a>&nbsp;facilitates government agencies and digital experts doing business together.

To date, it has contracted $3.53 billion worth of projects, with 70 per cent of them being awarded to SMEs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In March 2021, The Digital Transformation Agency was the leading government buyer with 35 opportunities, with software engineering and development the most sought after category by far. Other ICT specialities required include: Agile delivery and governance, support and operations, cybersecurity, strategy and policy, user research and design, change and transformation and ICT systems delivery, among other skills.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In short, business is booming for ICT right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many small businesses, now is the perfect time to consider scaling your business to meet demand, whether through organic growth or mergers or acquisitions with complementary companies..</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A business adviser can work with ICT businesses to understand strengths, growth strategy, sales and marketing, and the M&amp;A process to facilitate seamless growth to meet the ever-growing demand for ICT services. Mackay Goodwinâs business advisory arm has several ICT specialists able to work with your business and take advantage of the growing need for tech expertise across Government and private sectors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To arrange an obligation-free appointment, contact Michael Bogue on (02) 9220 7107.</p>\n","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","mediaItemUrl":"http://cms.mackaygoodwin.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Blog-cover-mailer-1-commercial-ICT.png"}},"slug":"ict-capabilities-strong-demand-within-government-despite-pandemic"},{"title":"10 Signs Your Business Needs to be Restructured","excerpt":"<p>Hundreds of Aussie companies collapse every year, and most businesses end up in liquidation rather than returning to trading.

With disruptive forces like technology and competitive market conditions, companies can find themselves in financial trouble very quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what are the signs you need to bring in the restructuring experts to bring your company back from the brink? If you can recognise these top signs, you can act quickly to seek expert advice. This will give your business the best chance of staying afloat and trading while you work your way back to a healthy balance sheet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>1. Poor competitiveness</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most obvious signs your company is in need of a restructuring process is youâre being beaten by your competitors. Youâre no longer number one or two in your industry, and the other market players are crushing your prices and surpassing you in everything from customer service to product quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poor competitiveness is an opportunity to rethink everything from your business model to organisational structure so your business can start ascending rather than falling behind your competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>2. Growth is stagnating</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to expand your business but youâre finding it impossible to achieve growth, itâs a sign your business could be due for a corporate restructuring. Your business might be maintaining a decent market share and enjoying a decent profit margin, but you canât seem to expand and scale up in the way you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Restructuring can help you uncover efficiencies and allow you to leverage the resources â from product and brand name to your team â you need to scale up and become a dominant player.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>3. Dramatic revenue drop</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Poor financial metrics are an obvious warning sign your business needs a restructure. Declining revenue can be a key indicator your business is no longer profitably structured. An abrupt, unexpected decline in revenue can set up a chain of events and cause non-payment of debt, tax, and even employee wages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A restructuring process can identify the causes and address them, helping you first break even and then return to profitability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>4. Cash-flow shortages</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If cash-flow shortages are a regular occurrence in your business, itâs time to look at restructuring. Your sales could be going up and you might be enjoying profitability, but the business is failing to collect revenue or has poor working capital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poor cash flow can threaten solvency, affect credit ratings with suppliers, compromise competitive advantage, and drag down your operations. A company restructure is the best way to address a cash-flow-poor business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>5. Lacking responsiveness</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond your financial metrics is dynamism and responsiveness. Poor management decision-making and ineffective internal communication with employees can lead to slow or failed attempts at responsive action. Your business might recognise thereâs a need for change, but your managers/staff lack the initiative to execute the large-scale changes you need. This can set off a vicious cycle where your high performers leave the organisation in frustration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can tackle manager and employee aversion to make drastic change by bringing in restructuring experts who can lead you business out of the danger zone and back to profitability in the most efficient and effective way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>6. Runaway expenses</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Runaway expenses are a top indicator that your business is in trouble. If youâre spending more than you make, you can be both cash-flow constrained and unprofitable. From there, itâs only a matter of time before youâre unable to pay suppliers, creditors, and other partners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Restructuring can identify your unnecessary expenses, cut out excessive costs, and return you to profitability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>7. Debt dependence</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Businesses heavily dependent on debt are burdened by the servicing of their borrowings. In turn, this restrains growth, cash flow, and ability to invest in sources of competitive advantage like product research and development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a business restructure, you can formulate a new strategy to pay back your debt while freeing up a good amount of profits to put back into growing the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>8. Poor efficiency</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Poor efficiency can be rooted in your business structure or the design of your operations. Whether itâs in your costs, operations, structure â or all three areas â roadblocks to efficiency can be identified with a restructure process and allow your business to reach its true potential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inefficiency can also have its origins in human resources and processes, and you end up having to hire more people without realising any efficiency gains. In this case, restructuring could also help you identify processes to streamline your operations, minimise the need to hire new staff, and continue to grow as an efficient business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>9. Shifting customer base</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether your customer base is diminishing, buying less or just looking for another product or service, a reduced customer base means your business could be ripe for restructuring. You might need to find a way to reduce the costs of production, introduce new product or service lines, or explore other revenue models for the same product, such as licensing or subscriptions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Restructuring could help you find new ways to deliver the same for less, shift into a new complementary product line, or otherwise meet your customer base where theyâre going.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>10. Sales decline</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A decline in sales volume is the clearest sign you could benefit from restructuring your organisation. Dropping sales (after accounting for seasonal and other expected variations) suggests your business could be at risk of insolvency and you may need to rethink how youâre doing things. A review of your operations and the market can help you identify the cause, and it could be your organisational structure that needs to change. In this situation, move quickly, seek advice, and implement the necessary changes to stay ahead of market and customer trends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keeping a watchful eye on your business allows you to act quickly when you need to. With a business restructure, a business on the brink can have the chance to restrategise and return to profitability. You can also identify any financial weaknesses and implement changes to have your operations thriving again. With restructuring comes the potential for a new start, so make sure you have the right experts to help you along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mackay Goodwin is a leading advisory firm specialising in corporate recovery, turnaround and restructuring.

Often, the risk taken does not provide the expected reward, and this is when you may need guidance from a expert corporate advisor. Here are some of the signs to look out for:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. You need an outside eye</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Itâs your business â you know it like the back of your hand. You have seen it grow from the start-up that you nurtured to the organisation that it is today. But not every problem is visible if youâre too close to it. Think of it as being stuck in a maze, and thereâs someone with a birdâs-eye view who can guide you home. And thatâs what Corporate Advisors are good at. They gauge a problem from a broad perspective, which may not be possible for someone who is intricately involved with the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Your business growth is stalling</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Every&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/industrylifecycle.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">industry and business has its own lifecycle</a>, from introduction through growth, maturity and finally, decline. However, there are invariably ups and downs that do not fit into this pattern. For example, the industry and business may be in the growth stage, but revenue growth may not be as fast as it should be, or is actually declining. Or perhaps the growth rate of the business does not match the industry growth rate, which means that the competition is taking market share.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. You are losing key personnel</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Employees are the most important assets a business has. But are your key employees contributing to growth? If you find that some of the personnel that have been with you since the beginning leave seeking greener pastures, it may be time to seek help. Corporate Advisors are experts not just in identifying the problem, but also in suggesting the resources to provide your business with the right solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Internal differences are stifling your business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Conflicts and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nfplaw.org.au/disputes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">internal disputes</a>&nbsp;are differences between the management, the board, and employees of an organisation. While disagreements are good if multiple perspectives lead to new solutions, internal conflicts could become a drag on productivity, compromising market opportunities and revenue generation in the long run. Corporate Advisors are capable of looking at issues from a neutral perspective, understanding the sources of conflict. It takes expert guidance to create consensus and provide direction, as well as experience in conflict management.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Managing cash flow is a challenge</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At any stage of the business life-cycle, cash flow is key. From paying your employee on time to meeting your debt repayment schedules, your operations could be thrown off track if cash flow is not managed appropriately. Corporate Advisors can look at your operations, stakeholder agreements and processes to find a solution to your cash flow problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>6. Scope for process efficiencies</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The business environment is constantly changing. This means that processes that were appropriate for your operations a few years back may need to be fine-tuned to suit a new reality. This is where the expertise of a Corporate Advisor could make a difference to your organisation. It takes a new perspective and expert analysis to understand the areas that need improvement. For example, process improvements like Six Sigma could drive productivity by eliminating inefficiencies and defects, leading to an improved bottom line.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>7. Need for investigative accounting</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Efficiencies in operations and processes should be accompanied with a specialised discipline called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/forensicaccounting.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">forensic or investigative accounting</a>. Business losses could be the result of deliberate misrepresentation of numbers, which could be undermining productivity and profitability. Corporate Advisors are equipped to deal with accounting that looks beyond conventional numbers and consider the complexity of business operations, in the context of business realities. If you are concerned about your books, specialist corporate advisors would be able to identify the problem areas and recommend solutions to get you back on track.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>8. Arranging for additional financing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The dip in business performance or the inability to exploit market opportunities may just be the result of insufficient finances. Sometimes, it could be just an additional injection of working capital that could turn the business around. It takes experienced Corporate Advisors to guide your organisation through the hassles of securing additional loans, by preparing and furnishing the required documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>9. Your business needs specialised skills</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Organisations cannot rest on their laurels in the face of new challenges. The new-age issues associated with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.apsc.gov.au/tackling-wicked-problems-public-policy-perspective\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">evolving wicked problems</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.csiro.au/en/Do-business/Futures/Reports/Our-Future-World\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">global megatrends</a>&nbsp;mean that your business needs to revamp its human resources, to exploit opportunities and resolve challenges. Corporate Advisors can perform a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.business.gov.au/people/managing-and-developing-staff/training/identify-your-skill-needs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">skills gap analysis</a>&nbsp;to outline your core expertise and understand your business needs, and advise your organisation on the specialised skills needed to take your business forward. When you have the right skills, your business is equipped to tackle the challenges that lie ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>10. Do you need to restructure to reinvent your business?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A thorough investigation of your current business affairs may reveal the need for a revamp. Restructuring is a complex initiative that takes expert advice from specialists. Corporate Advisors would be able to provide this, and oversee the exhaustive process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do any of these sound as if they apply to your business?

Personal insolvency, also known as Part X under the Bankruptcy Act, involves the appointment of a Trustee who would take charge of your properties and manage your creditors, making them offers of payment to settle your debts either through instalments or in a lump sum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personal insolvency normally releases you from being pursued by creditors to repay most kinds of unsecured debts upon completion of obligations under the agreement. An&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.afsa.gov.au/insolvency/i-am-owed-money/creditors-quick-guide-debt-agreements-and-unsecured-debts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">unsecured debt</a>&nbsp;is one that has not been secured with collaterals such as properties, as in the case of credit cards, personal loans, utility bills, unpaid rent or medical, legal and accounting fees.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is important to understand that entering into personal insolvency agreement is equivalent to committing an act of bankruptcy, which&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.afsa.gov.au/insolvency/i-cant-pay-my-debts/what-personal-insolvency-agreement/what-are-consequences-personal-insolvency-agreement\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">involves serious consequences</a>. Since personal bankruptcy agreements come with obligations and tend to be legally binding, it is important to seek personal advice from a financial counsellor before entering into formal agreements with creditors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How does personal insolvency impact a business?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is common for individuals to operate their business through a company to avoid prospects of their being held personally liable for the debts accumulated by the company. However, personal insolvency does have an impact on business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a person who is declared bankrupt would not be able to hold position as the director of a company. Entering into a personal insolvency agreement involves appointment of a trustee to manage your debts and coordinate with your creditors. This means that the trustee assumes responsibility for your debts as well as any shares that you may hold of your company, which essentially makes you forego control of your companyâs shares along with any form of ownership of the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is the trusteeâs responsibility to act in the common interests of creditors, and the trustee could&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.afsa.gov.au/sites/g/files/net1601/f/bankruptcyliquidationbrochure.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">take actions as deemed appropriate</a>, such as placing your company under liquidation or selling your company shares if that would help pay off the money due to your creditors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the trustee estimates that selling your companyâs shares or placing your company into liquidation would not yield sufficient value to settle your debts, it would be up to the creditors to approach the court to place your company into liquidation. Any of these actions on the part of the trustee or the creditors could have serious consequences for you and for your company, which warrants professional advice before personal insolvency decisions are made.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Responsibilities of a business director /owner if they are personally insolvent</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It becomes the obligation of someone who is personally insolvent to immediately appoint a trustee to manage the affairs of the company, their debt, and creditors. As a company owner who is declared bankrupt or one who has entered into personal insolvency agreements, it is imperative that you provide all information about your company, its assets and its values, to your trustee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trustee would replace you as the shareholder of the company, and it is your responsibility to give up all control of the company and cease to perform in the capacity of the director of the company under the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2018C00031\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">provisions of the Corporations Act</a>. The trustee evaluates the companyâs assets and repays creditors by realising the value of the bankrupt estate and by placing the company into liquidation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All claims against the director of the company become claims in their bankrupt estate. If a liquidator is appointed to the company, it is your responsibility, as a former director, to assist the liquidator in sorting out the companyâs affairs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What should your next step be?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are concerned that your personal finances may affect your business, particularly if you are facing personal insolvency and you are a company director or business owner, itâs important to take action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first step is to speak to the experts and find out exactly what is at stake.

Mackay Goodwin is currently working with HelloWorld Monbulk/Bentleigh in Victoria, which has proactively moved forward with a voluntary administration process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mackay Goodwin is also asking the Government for special consideration for the pandemicâs most impacted industries, such as travel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mackay Goodwin CEO Domenic Calabretta explains: âUnfortunately, the travel industry has been among the hardest hit by COVID-19, and I am saddened to think that there will be more voluntary and involuntary liquidations as JobKeeper is rewound.â</p>\n\n\n\n<p>âJob Keeper ends on March 28, and I urge the Government to find a solution for the travel industry and others, such as hospitality, which should be considered separate from other industries. Affected companies will need at least four weeks to cover redundancy provisions for staff unless a solution or extension to JobKeeper is delivered,â he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week Mackay Goodwin was appointed to Helloworld Monbulk/Bentleigh, which was placed into voluntary administration. Mr Calabretta is worried it is only the first of many travel companies who will find themselves in a similar situation by the end of next month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>âSadly, we know there will be more travel businesses experiencing hard times but acting now and seeking help means it wonât necessarily mean the end of the road,â he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HelloWorld Monbulk/Bentleigh Director Jennifer Watson explains: âWe sought help from Mackay Goodwin as soon as possible as we didnât want to leave it too late. We wanted to ensure we were doing the right thing by our staff and by our creditors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>âHelloworld Monbulk/Bentleigh is still trading whilst benefitting from the guidance of an experienced Mackay Goodwin restructuring expert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jennifer Watson explains: âWe are continuing to operate whilst in voluntary administration, and weâre focusing on getting back into the business of sending our valued customers on the holidays they have been missing. We are looking forward to the post-pandemic future.â</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Calabretta explains some of the options open to travel companies: âThere are a couple of routes open to struggling travel businesses if they act early and as soon as possible,â he says. âThe first step is to have a good handle on their financial position.â</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several options available to affected businesses, including voluntary administration or a small business restructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>âHaving the peace of mind that the restructuring expertise is there allows company directors and managers to focus on rebuilding the company and delivering an ongoing growth strategy,â he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Calabretta concludes by saying, âImpacted companies should seek help now, and not wait until JobKeeper dries up. Employee entitlements such as redundancies will need to be covered where a business may need to liquidate, so seeking help should give companies the peace of mind that an experienced financial adviser is supporting them.â</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Mackay Goodwin:</strong>&nbsp;Founded by CEO Domenic Calabretta, Mackay Goodwin is one of Australiaâs leading insolvency and restructure businesses and has carved a niche successfully working with stakeholders in distressed businesses.

Business tax debt has serious implications when left unpaid, so every business should be proactive in managing this type of debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Implications of unpaid business tax debt</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Unpaid business tax debt can cause serious issues for your business and expose you to legal action.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Disclosure to credit reporting bureaus</strong><br>The ATO can disclose your tax debt information to registered&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ato.gov.au/General/New-legislation/In-detail/Other-topics/Improve-the-transparency-of-tax-debts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">credit reporting bureaus</a>&nbsp;(CRBs). CRBs can include this information in credit reports. This means when your business is seeking credit, a poor tax debt history could hinder your application with banks and lenders.

Assess your financial situation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Take stock of whatâs happening in your business, and look at what you owe, and whatâs owed to you. Keep your records up to date and review key reports like cash flow statements and profit and loss statements. Talk to your accountant to get a clear picture of your businessâs finances.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Prioritise your tax debt</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Work out what you can pay now and what you can pay on an ongoing basis. Consider all your outflows and review what payments you can delay. Set up a budget to identify how youâll put aside the funds to pay your business tax debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Make sure youâre getting paid on time</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Non-paying and slow-paying receivables can slow down your payment cycles, making it a challenge for you to pay your business tax debt and expenses. If you have slow-paying customers, incentivise them to pay early with discounts. Shorten your payment terms, and apply a fine when customers pay late.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Lodge your activity statements and returns on time</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Make sure you&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/partner-content/articles/dont-let-ato-debt-harm-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lodge your activity statements and tax returns on time</a>, even if you canât pay. The ATO has separate penalties for late lodgement, so keep your lodgements up to date even as you negotiate your payment terms.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Communicate with the ATO</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay in contact with the ATO, especially if you canât pay your business tax on time. The ATO is more likely to look upon your case favourably if youâve made an attempt to fulfil your compliance obligations and keep them updated on your situation. Return the ATOâs calls and keep them notified of any new developments.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>6. Set up a payment plan</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>You can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Paying-the-ATO/Help-with-paying/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">set up a payment plan</a>&nbsp;with the ATO for your unpaid business tax debt. Review your finances and consider what a realistic payment plan might look like, and discuss this with the ATO. Youâll be charged interest on the plan, but ideally the periodic repayments will be manageable. If you canât reach a payment plan with the ATO, the ATO could consideraccepting a security (such as registered mortgage or bank guarantee) in exchange for deferring payment of your debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Itâs important to note however, you need to meet your repayments as they fall due under the payment plan, or the ATO could take action to recover the debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>7. Serious hardship and release</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If youâve experienced serious hardship and youâre an individual (sole trader), the ATO could considerreleasing you from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Financial-hardship/In-detail/Release-from-your-tax-debt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">some or all of your business tax debt</a>. Along with income tax, other types of tax debt like PAYG instalments, and fringe benefits tax could be released.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>8. Refinance your business tax debt</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>An alternative to implementing a payment plan is refinancing your business tax debt. If you fall behind in a payment to the ATO, the entire debt amount for the plan becomes due. In contrast, taking out a business loan to pay off your tax debt will ensure youâre up to date with your repayments without worrying about the ATO contacting you for repayments. However, as with any loan, youâll need to be certain your business can meet the repayment obligations.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>9. Get expert advice</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Obtain advice from trusted advisors, including your accountant, financial advisor, and even other experts like insolvency and business turnaround professionals. These experts could support you in better understanding whatâs happening in your business finances, so you can make smarter decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If youâre finding it hard to meet your business-tax obligations the problem could be due to poor cash-flow management, unsound business management practices, or other business-related issues. Turnaround experts could help you identify these shortcomings and devise a plan for getting your business back on track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meeting business tax obligation is a key compliance element for businesses, and unpaid tax debt can get out of hand and expose your organisation to action from the ATO. If you have concerned about paying off your debt, act quickly to devise a plan for repayment. By keeping the ATO involved and getting expert advice where necessary, youâll have a good chance of paying off your debt and keeping your business fully compliant.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Mackay Goodwin is Australiaâs leading turnaround, restructure, and insolvency consultancy.

Finding customers, managing staff, ensuring compliance, dealing with competition, managing risk and much more â youâre dealing with demands small to large every day. Failure is common, especially for new businesses, so what can you do to give your business exactly what it needs to grow and succeed? Debt financing could drive your business forward and give it the edge it needs to stay out of trouble.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is debt financing?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Debt financing is when your businessborrows money to be paid back with interest to run your business, and youâll have an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.business.qld.gov.au/starting-business/costs-finance-banking/funding-business/debt\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">agreed time frame for repayment</a>. Unlike equity financing, youâre not raising money by attracting investors who then have a stake (and claim over profits) over the business. You maintain ownership and control over your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use debt financing for any aspect of your business, whether itâs working capital or to make an acquisition. Your repayments could be monthly, half yearly, or towards the end of the loan term, depending on your agreement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Debt finance can be secured or unsecured against an underlying asset. Examples of debt finance include bank loans, overdrafts, mortgages, credit cards and equipment leasing or hire purchase. Note that with a business, debt financing interest, fees, and charges can be claimed against your business income.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Debt financing can be short term or long term. If youâre buying things like machinery, buildings, and equipment, the loan time frame could be longer than a year (and the asset used as security for the loan). Long-term debt finance can also beappropriate if youâre&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bondstreet.com/advantages-of-debt-financing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">employing more staff</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, short-term debt financing â such as a line of credit or credit cards â might be used for daily operations like supplies, inventory, and wages. With this type of loan you might have an agreement to repay within a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with any type of debt, an element of risk is involved so itâs important to consider how much debt you can sensibly take on and review your debt-to-equity ratio.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The benefits of debt financing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Debt financing isamong the most popular forms of financing. So, what makes it so widely used?</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Ownership and control&nbsp;</strong>â Unlike equity financing, debt financing allows you to retain complete control over your business. You donât have to answer to investors, therefore thereâs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://smallbusiness.chron.com/advantages-disadvantages-debt-equity-financing-55504.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">less potential for disagreements and conflict</a>. Even if itâs a secured loan, you would give up only on the collateral (and not your business) if you were to default.</li><li><strong>Tax</strong>&nbsp;â Debt financing comes with tax benefits, helping you reduce your tax bill. Since debt financing is a business loan and not a private, personal loan, you can claim a tax deduction on fees, charges, and interest.</li><li><strong>Profit sharing</strong>&nbsp;â With debt financing, your key obligation is to make the agreed payments on time. This is in contrast to equity financing, where you have to share your business profits with the equity investors.</li><li><strong>Accessibility</strong>&nbsp;â Get the capital you need to grow your business through a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://smallbusiness.findlaw.com/business-finances/debt-vs-equity-advantages-and-disadvantages.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">relatively straightforward process</a>. When compared to equity financing, debt financing tends to be less complicated because thereâs less compliance and you donât have to go through the process of screening equity partners or the convoluted process of negotiating and coming to an ownership agreement.</li><li><strong>Credit</strong><strong>history</strong>&nbsp;â You can use debt financing to establish a proven credit history to help your business secure other types of financing in the future.</li><li><strong>Planning</strong><strong>and</strong><strong>predictability</strong>&nbsp;â Youâll know exactly how much you need to repay, which helps with budgeting and planning.</li><li><strong>Flexibility</strong>&nbsp;â You can secure short-term, medium-term, or long-term loans for an amount appropriate for your businessâs needs.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Debt versus equity; which to choose?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While both debt and equity could help your business grow, itâs useful to consider the different implications they could have for your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Taking on debt means youâll need topay back the money with interest, while equity means youâll be sharing ownership and control. Debt wonât dilute your ownership interest. Additionally, you wonât need to share future profits of your business. As repayments and interest are more or less known in advance, you can easily plan your repayments. Debt is repaid at some point so unlike equity, it doesnât include a permanent change to your business (ownership).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, equity is considered a high-risk investment whilst debt is considered low risk, even though equity financing means an injection of funds without loan repayment obligations. At the same time however, having a high debt-to-equity ratio could constrain your business growth because youâre paying a lot to service your debt. Another issue to consider is that debt finance is technically a loan or liability of your business. On the other hand, equity finance is technically an asset of the company, as the injection is considered the businessâs own funds.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Exploring your businessâs finance options</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding debt versus equity financing is vital when youâre exploring ways to finance your business. When weighing up one or the other, consider things like debt-equity ratio, ownership, control, repayments, and your businessâs individual needs. If youâre using both types of financing, striking a balance between the two could optimise cash flow and ensure youâre getting an appropriate share of the profits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business is experiencing financial difficulties, but youâre not ready to give up, consider entering voluntary administration and turning your company around.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.mackaygoodwin.com.au/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Contact our expert team</a>&nbsp;and theyâll be able to help you with the next step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Call us now on 1300 750 599.</p>\n","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","mediaItemUrl":"http://cms.mackaygoodwin.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Debt-Financing.jpeg"}},"slug":"benefits-debt-financing-business"},{"title":"A Guide to Business Insolvency","excerpt":"<p>Owning your own business can be exciting, however itâs also filled with the prospect of making challenging decisions every day.

Faced with survive-or-perish choices, business owners need to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://zapier.com/blog/difficult-decisions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">think for the long term</a>&nbsp;and draw on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/business/trends-and-insights/articles/9-tips-to-help-you-handle-tough-business-decisions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">different perspectives</a>&nbsp;to make the right decisions. How to deal with business insolvency is one of the common challenges that face business owners. Here, we look at what it is, what causes it, and its implications.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Understanding business insolvency</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Business insolvency has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/insolvency/insolvency-for-directors/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">legal consequences</a>, especially for company directors, so itâs important to understand exactly when a business is considered insolvent. Insolvency happens when your business is unable to pay all debts when they become due for payment. While this sounds straightforward, in practice, it can be difficult to know exactly when a company has passed the boundary line between cash flow issues and legal insolvency. Things courts will look at to determine insolvency include continuing losses and no access to alternative finance. If a business is finding it hard to obtain alternative financing because lenders have little confidence in its ability to repay or itâs recording continuing losses, these are major red flags for business insolvency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courts might also look at things like a liquidity ratio thatâs below one (divide total liquid assets by amount of short term borrowing), overdue tax, and a lack of timely and accurate financial information. The liquidity ratio indicates how well short-term borrowing is covered by easily disposed assets, while overdue tax indicates the company is withholding tax payments to preserve cash flow. Other signs of financial difficulty include poor cash flow and unpaid creditors. From a creditorâs perspective, signs of business insolvency could be late payment of invoices, dishonoured payments, or post-dated cheques.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Itâs important to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/insolvency.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">distinguish insolvency from bankruptcy</a>. In Australia, bankruptcy is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.afsa.gov.au/insolvency/i-cant-pay-my-debts/what-bankruptcy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">legal process for individuals</a>, and itâs a declaration that youâre unable to pay your debts. Insolvency can lead to legal proceedings, including civil penalties, compensation proceedings and criminal charges for directors.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What causes insolvency?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Business insolvency can arise from a wide range of factors. Potential causes includepoor cash flow management, business decision making, and capital management. Some businesses run into financial trouble because of a lack of expertise in commercial operations, leading to a higher risk of failure. Others might encounter insolvency because of a lack of knowledge of business practices, not having adequate resources like capital and time, and/or spending too much on business development in an effort to drive growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Failure of customers to pay or being dragged down by a failing business are other possible causes. In addition, businesses can become insolvent due to strong competition, deficient financial management, and reliance on credit. Abrupt changes like essential staff members leaving and failure of clients on following through can rapidly affect your businessâs solvency. Several staff members leaving might set off other team departures if the departure of crucial talent affects your companyâs competitiveness and profitability. Similarly, reliance on a major client who goes bust and leaves invoices unpaid could quickly lead to insolvency for your company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unexpected events like loss of business premises, theft, or vandalism can have a sudden and dramatic impact on your ability to trade. In turn, this affects your cash flow and your business could become insolvent literally overnight. Although in some cases this could be mitigated by insurance, a major loss of physical assets can be disruptive enough to cause insolvency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The above causes can then lead into loss of capital, loss of revenue and loss of credit, which in turn lead directly to insolvency. Multiple problems can compound, leading to payments outstanding, credit issues, and other serious challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What happens next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Directors have aduty to prevent their companies from incurring further debt when the company becomes insolvent. If you can quickly restructure, refinance, or secure equity funding and recapitalise your business, you should probably appoint a voluntary administrator or a liquidator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voluntary administration sees a voluntary administrator appointed to take full control of the business. She or he will be tasked with finding a way to save the company or its business. If thatâs not possible, the voluntary administrator needs to administer the companyâs affairs to provide creditors with a return thatâs better than if the company had gone straight into liquidation. In the process, the company might return temporarily or permanently to trading through a deed of company arrangement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively the company could be liquidated, meaning it will be shut down for good. This involves a liquidator taking control to wind up the company for the benefit of its creditors. A third pathway is receivership, which is usually initiated by a secured creditor who holds security over some or all of the companyâs assets. The receiver will collect and sell enough of the companyâs charged assets to repay the debt. The company could continue to exist after receivership has ended.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Getting a fresh financial start for your business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Business insolvency can have legal implications for company directors. If you run a business, you need to be aware of how to know if your company is insolvent and the underlying causes. Company directors in particular should be aware of potential next steps so they can act quickly to address business insolvency if it occurs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes a fresh financial start requires more extreme action than simply changing up a daily habit â such as entering into voluntary administration, or restructuring your organisation. Thatâs where we can help. Weâre the experts, so contact us on 1300 750 599 to discuss your circumstances.</p>\n","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","mediaItemUrl":"http://cms.mackaygoodwin.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Business-Insolvency.jpeg"}},"slug":"a-guide-to-business-insolvency"},{"title":"Understanding the Difference Between Good Debt and Bad Debt","excerpt":"<p>Not all debt is bad, and understanding the difference between good and bad debt could enable you to make smarter decisions about how to grow your business. Recognising the impact &#8230;</p>\n","content":"\n<p>Not all debt is bad, and understanding the difference between good and bad debt could enable you to make smarter decisions about how to grow your business. Recognising the impact of bad debt is critical when it comes to understanding that your business might be heading for trouble. We explore what is good debt and bad debt, the impact of them both, and what you can do about both types of debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Good debt and its impact on your business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all debt is bad. Good debt is the type of debt that supports your business growth and ability to create wealth. Whether a debt is good or not can also depend on how you use it. For example, your business could borrow money to buy an asset that generates income for the business, and the return on investment for the asset exceeds its after-tax interest cost. Alternatively, if youâre in a seasonal industry, you could use a business loan or line of credit to balance out uneven cash flow in the slower seasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as a general rule of thumb,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.smartcompany.com.au/partner-content/articles/debt-good-bad-ugly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">good debt generates</a>&nbsp;more value or money than the loan itself costs. Good debt has a positive impact on your business: it allows you to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/305425\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">expand by financing things</a>&nbsp;like equipment, premises, skilled employees, and marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Bad debt and its impact on your business</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bad debt for businesses can take two forms. The first is a loss your business incurs because youâve&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/baddebt.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">extended credit to customers and/or it canât be repaid</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iknow.cch.com.au/topic/tlp1641/overview/bad-debts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recovered</a>. This could be because your customers have financial problems or you canât collect. This type of debt is expensed on your income account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another type of bad debt could be a loan your business takes out to finance things like growth or day-to-day operations. A bad debt tends to be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/good-debt-vs-bad-debt-know-difference/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">expensive (high interest)</a>&nbsp;and may make you fall into a debt cycle where the debt becomes unmanageable and your business finds it harder to pay off the debt. Bad debt costs your business money without enhancing your financial situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some cases, bad debt can just be a good debt thatâs been poorly managed. Your ability to repay it can be compounded by the first type of bad debt. For example, when customers canât pay you, it affects your cash flow, profitability, and ability to make repayments on your debt obligations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So bad debt can affect your bottom line, disrupt your day-to-day activities by affecting cash flow, constrain growth, and even threaten the survival of your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to deal with good debt</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Even good debt can become bad debt if you donât keep how much you borrow under control. Always have a plan for paying off debt eventually (even good debt) and try to pay off the more expensive forms of good debt before the cheaper good debt. Delay major expenses where possible so youâre not accumulating unnecessary good debt, and keep to a strict business budget to keep costs under control. Look for ways to keep your business productive without accumulating extra debt. Monitor your debt-to-equity ratio regularly. Track customer payments and make sure your business is getting paid on time. If you have multiple forms of good debt, consider consolidating them to keep fees down and make repayments more manageable.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to deal with bad debt</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have bad debt in the tax sense â as in, itâs unrecoverable or canât be collected â you have to write it off as bad debt and follow other tax and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.myob.com/au/blog/common-accounting-questionsbad-debt/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">accounting compliance processes</a>&nbsp;relating to bad debt. In addition, you could implement a debt management and recovery program to deal with things like cash flow, overdue payments, stronger payment terms, and credit control systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alternatively, if your business has bad debt itâs finding hard to pay off, you should take action as soon as possible. Company directors in particular&nbsp;<a href=\"https://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/insolvency/insolvency-for-directors/insolvency-a-guide-for-directors/#duties\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">have a duty to not trade while insolvent</a>, and breaching this duty can mean serious legal consequences.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Get advice&nbsp;</strong>â If your business is heading for financial trouble,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.business.gov.au/closing/bankruptcy\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">get advice</a>&nbsp;from professionals like restructuring, business-turnaround, and insolvency experts as a matter of urgency. This will let you explore the options available and act quickly to stay out of trouble.</li><li><strong>Work with creditors&nbsp;</strong>â You could approach creditors to make new repayment arrangements, allowing you to repay your debts in a manageable timetable.</li><li><strong>Restructuring&nbsp;</strong>â Restructuring and turnaround measures could give your business a lifeline, allowing you to repay debts and keep operating.</li><li><strong>Insolvency proceedings&nbsp;</strong>â Processes like voluntary administration, receivership, and liquidation are last-resort measures that result in shutting down your business and, less commonly, turning your business around.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is your business experiencing financial difficulties?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Good debt drives your business forward, helping you to grow faster, while bad debt can constrain growth or even threaten the survival of your company. A smart approach to good and bad debt means reviewing your debts and prioritising repayments. If your business has a lot of bad debt, itâs important to seek advice as soon as possible so you can avoid insolvency issues and give your business the best chance of turning around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your business is experiencing financial difficulties, but youâre not ready to give up, consider entering voluntary administration and turning your company around.

It might seem like everything is going swimmingly one month, only for the doors to come down the next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that many business owners struggle to recognise is the signs that their business is under stress until itâs too late, but often a business can be saved if the warning signs are flagged early.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what are the most common warning flags that businesses face? Itâs often surprising, but signs that a business might be under financial duress can often be found outside of the financial books.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Signs your business is in financial trouble</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>1. Major clients have left the organisation</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The typical business will have multiple clients or customers, and those clients will be of varying importance. This can often leave an odd sense of security about the soundness of the revenue coming in, even if one of the major clients has left the business. After all, even if thereâs one fewer contract, revenue is still coming in, staff are still busy, and workâs getting turned over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The loss of an important client might not be felt for a month, two, or even longer, but at some point, unless youâre able to bring onboard a new top-tier client, or upsell an existing one, there will be a point that the lost revenue will bite into the businessâ financial health.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be careful, as well, in bringing on a new client â it means revenue is coming, but thereâs still going to be a period of time from when the contract is signed until the revenue from that client starts to boost your businessâ cash flow.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>2. Youâre losing your best performers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As a rule, companies donât like churn at any time because an employee that moves on means youâve lost skills and talent that youâve invested in, and your company structure stability is affected. However, you should be paying especially close attention to the movements of your best performers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Losing a top salesperson will have a bigger impact on revenue than losing a junior member of the team. Losing a favourite support contact for a large number of clients might well result in you losing some â if not all â of those clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You will, of course, have a transition process so that an outbound staff member will âhandoverâ their work, projects, and contact information to their successor. Theyâll also cover introductions, but nonetheless, no matter how well you plan the transition, instability can have a significant impact on short term revenue. Youâre much better off identifying if thereâs a cultural problem thatâs causing staff to leave, and to address that as a way of protecting your business revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>3. Youâre not able to replace outbound employees</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone does leave the organisation, and you look at their workload and say to yourself âI canât justify bringing someone new on to handle this,â or you simply canât find the budget for a replacement, then itâs likely that between the time in which the employee joined your organisation, and when they left, their workloads declined, meaning less revenue and opportunities for your organisation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes departments become redundant, and sometimes job losses are inevitable to the company, but under-productivity in business units that you are keeping is a sign that your business might not be run efficiently enough, which can have knock-on effects to profitability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>4. Youâre not paying your bills on time</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This one might sound obvious, but itâs amazing how many business owners donât see this as a huge priority. If youâre not paying your companyâs bills on time, then thereâs something wrong with the financial position of the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge is in understanding what is going wrong. Often it will be an issue of cash flow â i.e. youâre got more expenses that cash on hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of other things that might affect cash flow, however. Inventory is a common one for organisations that sell products. Credit policies are another, if for whatever reason repayments are not made on time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your cash flow is not managed properly, and you end up relying on the stars aligning so that you can pay your own bills, it should be a big warning flag that your company is skating on thin ice.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>5. Youâre no longer communicating financial results to your staff</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Precisely because you donât want to lose your best people, youâre going to want to project positive messages to your staff about the performance of the company and its future prospects. One thing that youâll never be able to conceal, however, is if the financial position is dire. Employees are comfortable with the standard up and downs of business performance, but if thereâs a one-way direction in revenue and profitability over a period of time, then theyâre likely to start spending their lunch breaks updating their LinkedIn profiles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Use those company-wide update meetings as a litmus test for the performance of the company. If the subtle shifts have turned negative over a longer period of time, then use that as an encouragement to look much more closely at the books.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rarely will the warning signs that a company is in trouble be projected clearly. Instead, there will be challenges in the day-to-day management of the company that point to a greater problem.

Unlike liquidation, external voluntary administration wonât necessarily result in the company being wound down. For insolvent businesses and companies with cash-flow issues, the voluntary administration process can provide an opportunity by giving breathing space from certain types of creditor action, allowing the business to assess how they move forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accountants can be an invaluable partner for an voluntary administrator tasked with identifying the key areas of a business that need to be reviewed during a voluntary administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>The voluntary administration process</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Voluntary administration can be&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://australiandebtsolvers.com.au/research-centre/comprehensive-guide-voluntary-administration/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">initiated by the company directors or a secured creditor</a>. Once the voluntary administration process is initiated, the company hits a âpause buttonâ with reduced risk of action from creditors. During this process, which might last around one month, an external administrator is brought in and he or she takes over control of the company from the directors. The companyâs assets are protected during the process, and the administratorâs role is to figure out a&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/insolvency/insolvency-for-creditors/voluntary-administration-a-guide-for-creditors/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">way to save the company</a>&nbsp;if possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three possible scenarios can result from voluntary administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li>The company could be liquidated.</li><li>A deed of company arrangement (DOCA) could be executed to allow the company to continue trading and pay off its creditors.</li><li>The company could be returned to the control of the directors.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>Accountants can assist the administrator in everything from investigating the companyâs books to formulating a DOCA to help the business resume trading and return to profitability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Assisting the external administrator</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The director(s) (or secured creditors) can appoint the administrator, who must be a registered liquidator with the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC). The administrator may also be a qualified accountant and have extensive experience as an accountant. During the process of the voluntary administration the administrator may work with other accountants to investigate the companyâs affairs and to formulate their final recommendation. The administrator could also work with specialist accounts who have significant experience with insolvency, tax, or DOCA-related issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>The investigation</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After the first meeting of creditors, the voluntary administrator is required to make their assessment and report back to the creditors. This report summarises the results of his or her investigation of the companyâs affairs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accountants working with the voluntary administrator can assist the administrator during both the investigation and the preparation of the report. For example, businesses with complex financial affairs can have extensive financial records that are time-consuming for the administrator alone to analyse. Accountants can assist with gathering evidence about total debts outstanding to the business, and which creditors are owed what.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The accountants will want to look into the cash-flow health of the business, as well as employee benefits and wages. Issues like non-payment of suppliers, credit issues with banks, and running at a loss can be identified by checking the books (if the books have been maintained accurately).</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>The administratorâs report</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Accountants assisting the voluntary administrator can also be of assistance during the report-writing stage. With their technical and numerical expertise in relation to the business, they may be able to assist in translating the findings into an easy-to-understand format for the creditors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The administratorâs report should include<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://asic.gov.au/regulatory-resources/insolvency/insolvency-for-creditors/voluntary-administration-a-guide-for-creditors/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&nbsp;enough information&nbsp;</a>to help creditors understand the business, its assets and property, affairs, and financial situation. The purpose is to allow the creditors to have a solid understanding of the business before they attend the second creditorsâ meeting, where the future of the business is decided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report should also cover what creditors might reasonably expect to receive in the event of the proposed course of action and what they might receive if the company is liquidated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>The voluntary administratorâs statement</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the voluntary administratorâs report, the voluntary administratorâs statement must be provided to creditors before the meeting. The statement sums up the voluntary administratorâs opinion on which option is best for creditors, whether itâs a return to the directorsâ control, DOCA, or winding up and liquidation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Accountants who are assisting the voluntary administrator as he or she conducts the investigation and writes their report can assist with supporting evidence for the administratorâs statement, particularly in the reasons for the options available. Creditors can benefit from having factual evidence with numbers and records to inform their decision and vote. As for the report, evidence relating to the companyâs likely profitability, overall debt burden, and ability to pay off debt will be relevant here, and the accountant whoâs helping the administrator will be well-place to contribute to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a DOCA is proposed, you as the accountant can assist the administrator in putting together sufficient details about the DOCA to help the creditors with their decision. Youâll want to demonstrate with numerical proof how the company could pay off all or some of its debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><em>Strategic insights</em></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally during the investigation, report-writing, and statement-writing stages, you as the accountant can assist the administrator with auditing financial statements, reviewing the books, and even using projections to predict how the business could resume trading and generate sufficient income to repay its debts. This should take into account compliance and tax implications. Again, projection or modelling could be helpful here to identify how the company can return to profitability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition, as an accountant with prior knowledge of the businessâ capabilities and process you could be of assistance with creating growth strategies and identifying ways to cut costs. In this way, you could assist the administrator with formulating a strong DOCA and a way forward towards profitability for the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mackay Goodwin is a leading advisory firm specialising in corporate recovery, turnaround and restructuring.

It doesnât actually matter what size your business is â whether itâs a sole proprietor right through to a large corporation, if youâre looking to make your business a sustainable success, the budget will be the cornerstone of what you do.</p>\n","content":"\n<p>You need a budget for your business. It doesnât actually matter what size your business is â whether itâs a sole proprietor right through to a large corporation, if youâre looking to make your business a sustainable success, the budget will be the cornerstone of what you do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The budget is important to your business not only because it helps you maintain its financial health, though knowing what revenue is coming in and what expenditure your business is making is certainly one of the major roles of a budget. Thereâs more to it than that. A budget also acts as a roadmap of sorts for your business; it shows you where youâre planning on spending the revenue thatâs coming into the business, how profit might be used or distributed, and the cost of the major projects that youâre looking to undertake.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A budget also tells you at a glance if you can afford opportunities that can spring up out of nowhere. You may have a great hiring opportunity, but without a budget you could not be sure if payroll would be able to cover that opportunity. You might want to undertake a large advertising campaign, or expand the number of shops that you have, and, again, the budget will tell you if your companyâs financial health can accommodate those opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, a budget will help you account for the kind of future costs that can otherwise be pushed out of mind too easily. Everyone knows that tax time rolls around like clockwork every year, and yet so many business owners start to worry about that only as theyâre filing their paperwork. Conversely, a budget can also help you prepare for the good times; if you run a business that has a highly seasonal revenue base (say, a swimwear store, when the difference in winter and summer revenues would be significant), then the budget will help you have clarity on how to get through the lean seasons, while maximising the opportunity of the lucrative ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to build a business budget</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For non-accountants, the idea of building a budget can be an intimidating one. It doesnât need to be, though. Many people go into a budget with the wrong idea, thinking that they need to track and account for every dollar â this isnât the case at all. A budget is not a formal document that youâll be submitting to the tax department or similar. Instead, it should be a guide to assist you in making better spending decisions for your business, and finding new opportunities to improve the profitability of the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A budget can even be based on different revenue models. Some business leaders prefer to budget based on cash flow, while others like to estimate net income on an accrual basis. Either approach is fine, as the goal here is â again â to get an overview of the business and plan for its future. Itâs not about drilling down to every dollar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other useful tips for building your budget:</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Donât create a budget by yourself</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Within your organisation, there are going to be multiple people responsible for sticking to a budget, so make sure that you get their input. Ask them what they need within their particular field of responsibility, where they see waste and opportunities for better efficiency within the organisation, and where they feel inhibited in doing their work. The more people that you can get involved with the creation of the budget â at all levels within the organisation â the more true picture of the organisation it will paint.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Be conservative in your approach</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>While you should be approaching your business with a positive spirit, when setting down the budget itself, it pays to be conservative. The business world has a habit of throwing curveballs at the most inopportune times, and a conservative budget is the one that will have the capacity to absorb a body blow or two. If your targets are too high, or your spending is too on the edge, itâs only going to take a tiny disaster to tip you over.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Be flexible</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The best budgets are the ones that are amended a few times over the course of the year to take into account new opportunities, unexpected loses, and so on. An organisation that is unwilling to deviate from an existing budget and rewrite it as circumstances change through the year wonât be agile enough.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember: a budget is not meant to be a crutch that prevents your organisation from making the investments that it needs to. Rather, a budget helps you to outline the vision for your company, and present a pathway to achieve that vision without creating a risk that the company could go bankrupt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For more information on building and maintaining an effective budget, contact the team at Mackay Goodwin today â&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mackaygoodwin.com.au/#contact\">online</a>&nbsp;or on 1300 750 599.</p>\n","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","mediaItemUrl":"http://cms.mackaygoodwin.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Budget-for-Your-Business.jpeg"}},"slug":"need-budget-business"},{"title":"How will a business health check change the direction of your business?","excerpt":"<p>If youâre in survival mode right now, youâre not alone.

It can also help you become more customer-centric, give you inspiration to revise sales and marketing plans, and help transform your organisational structure and culture.<br>A business health check is a powerful opportunity for your business to diagnose areas for improvement and maintenance, and should give actionable, measurable suggestions to improve your diagnosis in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>An action plan for healthy growth</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After youâve submitted all your health-check answers, an independent business adviser will prepare an action plan for healthy growth in the short, medium and long term. Ultimately itâs always up to you to accept or reject parts of the diagnosis that arenât helpful â your business is your baby and no one knows it better than you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you complete a Mackay Goodwin health check, one of our expert advisors will consult with you to decide what actions are needed to produce the positive changes your business plan indicates, the resources required and the timeline for change. This gives you the clarity and confidence to act without hesitation, and some clear goal posts to work towards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can then give a clear picture of your eligibility for government financial support, and advise on other government initiatives, such as Safe Harbour reforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mackay Goodwinâs free Business Health Check</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Free, fast and easy to use</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the pandemic having such an effect on business, Mackay Goodwin is offering free business health checks for Australian companies of all sizes, to help them get back on track post COVID-19 shutdowns.
