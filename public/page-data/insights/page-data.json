The main concerns of the cohort in regard to Cyber security was the risk of losing of data, >40% represented the biggest risk vector which I found personally remarkable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s often banded around that data is the new oil, data is the crown jewels of an organisation and of course in the event of a breach losing that data has some significant implications for a business including loss of reputation, loss of confidence, loss of customers, and fines</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, if we overlay the recent cost of a data breach from IBM published last month we see that data breach costs rose from $3.86 million in 2020 to $4.24 million, the highest average total cost in the history of the report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, it reported data breaches that took longer than 200 days to identify and contain cost on average $4.87 million, compared to $3.61 million for breaches that took less than 200 days. Overall, it took an average of 287 days to identify and contain a data breach, seven days longer than in the previous report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, the costs are going up, the risks are elevated and ransomware is at an all-time high for businesses. We also know that COVID-19 has brought about several key changes in the way we all work. Remote workers will continue to be a target for cybercriminals moving forward. We also know that the attacker is the one innovating-as businesses are merely responding to that innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, James discussed that 95% of cybersecurity breaches are caused by human error, therefore, the focus must be on enabling education and governance around Cyber Security for your business. Whilst the idea of humans being your first layer of defence is discussed all the time, it’s still true.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we can uplift an individual’s awareness and skillset to spot nefarious attacks, we can lower risk for a business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what can you do today to get on the front foot and not be a statistic?  We recommend some simple tips to be aware off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top 5 Tips to Identify a Phishing Email</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users all across the globe receive an average of 16 malicious emails every month! Additionally, with the host of email subscriptions that we consciously sign up for, a careful examination of an email before our response could be quite taxing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nevertheless, awareness is key to foiling potential attempts of stealing your confidential personal or business data. Here are some tips on how to spot a phishing email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Stay Clear of any Demand of Sensitive Information via Email</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember that a legitimate organisation would never demand your sensitive personal or financial information through an email. Moreover, a company that you usually deal with would rather direct you to a phone conversation for any information about your account. Beware of unsolicited emails that demand personal information and contain a link or attachment. It is definitely a scam!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Be Wary of Generic Email Salutations</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Steer clear of emails (usually, marketing emails) that address you as a ‘valued member’, ‘valued customer’, ‘customer’ or ‘account holder’. One must avoid emails containing such generic salutations at all costs as they are usually spam emails. Remember that a genuine company would address you by your name.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, some cyber conmen are avoiding the salutation part of the email altogether! So, make sure you refer to the other points in this checklist to identify if it’s malicious or genuine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Check the Domain in the Email Address of the Sender</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most important tips to spot a phishing email is to closely examine the sender’s address. Check the domain in the email address i.e., the part that comes after ‘@’. This would give you a fair idea about the origin of the email and hence its authenticity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cybercrime masterminds often alter the spelling here and there to make the domain look legitimate. So, exercise caution! Although, this is also not a foolproof tip as companies often use unique or miscellaneous domains to reach out to their customers. In fact, small-scale companies rely on third-party email providers to send emails. So the dubious-looking domain may actually be a genuine one!</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Spelling Errors Should Ring a Warning Bell</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember one thing! Every brand and every company has a team of proof-readers and copywriters. This to ensure that the content that they put out to customers is free from errors, factual and grammatical. An erroneous content, especially in an email to a potential or existing customer is a huge embarrassment for the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hence, it’s obvious that an email from a valid enterprise would be well written. On the contrary, one can easily identify scam emails by their grammatical and spelling errors. Obviously, hackers are no fools either! They know their target audience and such phishing emails are mostly targeted at the lower strata of the education pyramid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Watch out for Unsolicited Attachments</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you know what the most popular bait in phishing emails is? Unsolicited and suspicious-looking attachments and links. A genuine organization never sends emails with random attachments or links. They would rather direct the user to their own website to download documents or files if required.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, companies that do have your contact details may send you white papers, newsletters, etc. as an attachment. So, this isn’t again a complete reliable trick although, you must be wary of attachments having .exe, .scr, and .zip extensions. The best way out is to contact the sender directly in case of any doubt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, cyber risk is divided into three main pillars. Your people, your governance, and your technology. We are here to help evaluate each of those risks to lessen the chances of an event which as you can see, prove to be expensive reputationally and fiscally</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Continuum Cyber is happy to offer your business a free Cyber assessment and discuss what steps you can take to get Cyber safe.

Meanwhile, these clients are scrambling to identify new growth pathways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of that, time and money that perhaps should have been spent planning for the future has been tangled up in managing the ‘now’ of 2020, which continues still as directors deal with the ongoing uncertainty around how much COVID will affect the economy into 2021.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Navigating the safe harbour</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recognising that directors would need extra protections because of the COVID-19 crisis, the Federal Government introduced its emergency ‘safe harbour’ legislation in March 2020, allowing directors the time to assess their company’s position before developing further plans, either for turnaround or insolvency administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The relevant amendment, found in<a href=\"http://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/ca2001172/s588gaaa.html\">&nbsp;section 588GAAA</a> of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth)</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>suspended provisions that would otherwise hold directors personally liable for trading while insolvent as a kind of <a href=\"https://aicd.companydirectors.com.au/-/media/cd2/resources/director-resources/director-tools/pdf/06547-1-director-tools-insolvency-safe-harbour-a4-9pp-web.ashx\">“defence” in some circumstances</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As the economy starts to recover, it will be critical that distressed businesses have the necessary flexibility to restructure or to wind down their operations in an orderly manner,” the Treasury <a href=\"https://ministers.treasury.gov.au/ministers/josh-frydenberg-2018/media-releases/extension-temporary-relief-financially-distressed\">media release</a> explained, the aim being to “help to prevent a further wave of failures before businesses have had the opportunity to recover”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The temporary safe harbour law is just that – temporary</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Originally the safe harbour laws were set to expire in September 2020, but as economic impacts from the pandemic showed no signs of abating, the exemption was extended until 31 December 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What isn’t made crystal clear in the legislation but is a real risk for companies, is that directors who trade on an insolvent business past the 31 December end date may be exposed to the usual insolvent trading provisions – for any period when the company was insolvent, should the company later end up in liquidation &#8211; even if that period was between March and 31 December 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The COVID-19 safe harbour protection may only apply if directors take proactive steps to appoint an external administrator or liquidator&nbsp;prior to&nbsp;31 December 2020. So, with this in mind, a prudent course of action for directors involves three steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. <strong><u>Seek professional advice</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As ASIC says, “<a href=\"https://asic.gov.au/about-asic/news-centre/articles/directors-duties-in-the-context-of-covid-19/\">Directors are encouraged to seek advice early</a> from a suitably qualified and independent advisor about the company’s financial affairs and the options available to manage the disruption caused by COVID-19.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under current economic conditions, it’s incumbent upon directors to get your accounts and records in order and solicit expert advice – the earlier the better, for the best chance of surviving the present and thriving into the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To gain a full picture of your company’s prospects in this uncertain trading environment directors need to embark on a full and honest evaluation of the issues facing your company, including, for example, how much you’re relying on government subsidies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You need to consider whether your business is still viable but perhaps suffering from&nbsp;temporary liquidity challenges that can be addressed through restructure; or in the case of an insolvency, whether the company is still feasible; or whether your business is insolvent with no viable option to save it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the right advice, directors may be able to see the COVID-19 crisis as an opportunity to transform your business and to create options when it seems like there are none: there may well be a better outcome than the appointment of a liquidator or voluntary administrator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. <u style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Appoint an external administrator before 31 December, if deemed necessary<br></u></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As outlined above, safe harbour laws state that an external administrator must be appointed to your company before the moratorium’s expiry on 31 December 2020, if the debts incurred are to be excluded from a liquidator’s claim for insolvent trading.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So –&nbsp;if you are in any doubt about whether you might need to rely on the COVID-19 safe harbour protection, or if there is any risk that your company might be placed into external administration in the future, you&nbsp;mustconsider whether an appointment of a voluntary administrator or liquidator should be made on or before 31 December 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the case where a company is placed into formal insolvency, directors will need advice on compliance with regulatory obligations on provision of books and information and assistance to a liquidator, administrator or controller.<br><br>3. <strong><u>Planning for the long term</u></strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While there may be a temptation to focus on the ‘now’ and all its pressing needs, plans must be made for a time beyond mere survival, to recovery and beyond. Directors must use this year of profound change as a lesson in the absolute necessity for business continuity plans and corporate resilience building.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Directors may need advice on lending, cashflow, restructuring, forensics, improving efficiencies to avoid financial trouble and putting together an investigative accounting report. Sound planning is best achieved through a collaborative process between you and your advisory expert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How Mackay Goodwin can help</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We follow a mantra at Mackay Goodwin: If you don’t give up, we won’t either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some firms take an ‘Insolvency first’ approach, Mackay Goodwin is a corporate advisory, restructuring and recovery firm with an approach that focuses on keeping businesses viable and able to trade into the future.

For this particular security company, the sheer magnitude of size for the companies of those contracts ultimately led them into incurring significant working capital difficulties, largely formed by insufficiently detailed terms and deliverables combined with timeline blowout, which ultimately formed an unsustainable pattern of loss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a time, the company declared insolvency. Continued difficulties had led them to be unable to sufficiently contribute their taxes, and they owed over $2 million to unsecured creditors (as well as almost $400,000 in employee entitlements, including annual leave payments and outstanding employee superannuation contributions). This, in turn, led to suppliers refusing to provide credit, which forced them deeper into financial difficulties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under Section 588G of the Corporations Act 2001, directors can be held personally liable if they knowingly allow a company to continue trading whilst insolvent. The only remaining course for the directors was to appoint a Voluntary Administrator to oversee the process and attempt to provide any chance of saving the company, as well as securing debts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mackay Goodwin was contacted, and immediately begun the moratorium process for Voluntary Administration. We focused upon beginning smaller, more secure, more detailed, and ultimately more profitable contracts in order to build up sufficient resources to handle both large and small companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voluntary Administration can in the business world sometimes carry stigma about it, but oftentimes a company needs restructuring in order to stabilise before it readjusts position in order to build towards financial stability. This process takes between 1-2 months in most cases, during which trading continues normally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of the Voluntary Administration process, a&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://australiandebtsolvers.com.au/research-centre/explaining-deed-company-arrangement/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Deed of Company Arrangement</a>&nbsp;(DOCA) was entered into for the security company. A DOCA is an agreement between a company and the creditors that it owes money to, outlining the division of debts, and any potential assets that may be used to repay them. The reason a bipartisan Administrator is appointed for this is that the agreement is best served – both for each company and the reputation of the insolvent group – as a way to find an adequate solution for all parties, rather than just the creditor or debtor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, the DOCA maintained full compensation for employee entitlements and superannuation, 6-22 cents per dollar to creditors, and was able to reduce 85% of overall debt. This allowed Kudos to maintain trading, and they’re now in a position of further expansion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The security company director said that their experience with Mackay Goodwin and the Voluntary Administration process was the best option for the business, as it allowed them to continue to grow. They’re very glad they decided to go with this option.</p>\n","slug":"security-company-case-study","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","mediaItemUrl":"http://growingcolossus.com/mackaygoodwin/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GettyImages-617766704-scaled.jpg"}}},{"title":"Building Developer Case Study","excerpt":"<p>This South Australian builder continues to trade, thanks to a DOCA, restructure and dispute resolution When an Adelaide building development company found itself in a lengthy and protracted legal dispute &#8230;</p>\n","content":"\n<h3>This South Australian builder continues to trade, thanks to a DOCA, restructure and dispute resolution</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When an Adelaide building development company found itself in a lengthy and protracted legal dispute over a costly project, it found itself unable to trade out of the heavy losses it had incurred as a result of the deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company had multiple ventures and millions of dollars tied within a grouping of properties, which they now discovered they had no direct ownership over due to undocumented agreements with external parties.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite the Supreme Court ruling in the favor of the company, the news was too little and too late. They had accrued $6 million total in debt, with no concrete way of paying them back. In order to ensure the continued survival of the company, the repayment of all unsecured creditors (including dozens of subcontractors and suppliers) and to ensure that he would keep his builder’s license, the director agreed to place the company into Voluntary Administration with Mackay Goodwin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this left clients without homes still under construction, and placed some employees in a position of unemployment, this action was deemed necessary in order to protect the existing debt and make sure operations could resume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Voluntary Administration moratorium is a brief period of time, usually between one and two months, where an appointed bipartisan administrator attempts to secure debt in the best interests of all parties involved, both debtor and creditor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company was allowed to remain trading during the time, and at the end of it we determined that a Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA) should be entered into between the company and its creditors. Under this agreement, unsecured creditors would receive between 40 and 50 cents to the dollar over the period of several months, a figure far exceeding that which they would have received if the company would have gone bankrupt or wound up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A moratorium is a multi-stage process. Firstly, the administrator seeks strategies that would attempt to improve the overall stability of the company; this can include minor changes or entire restructuring of assets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After this has been completed, creditors are met and their demands cycled through in such a way to maximise benefit for all affected parties. Once an accord has been reached, control of the company is handed back over to the Director.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mackay Goodwin achieved considerable success, securing 40-50c to the dollar for unsecured creditors, full return for those secured creditors affected, and left the company in a position to re-hire priority employees while keeping their builder’s license.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today the building development company is continuing to trade successfully thanks to its Voluntary Administration intervention. The director stated that he and the company were very appreciative of the administration team and what they helped the company to achieve through the process.</p>\n","slug":"building-developer-case-study","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","mediaItemUrl":"http://growingcolossus.com/mackaygoodwin/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/GettyImages-1180336055-scaled.jpg"}}},{"title":"Earthmoving Company Case Study","excerpt":"<p>75% reduction in tax debt gets this earthmoving company moving again By the time a Melbourne-based earthmoving company contacted Mackay Goodwin over reducing their accrued debt, they had build up &#8230;</p>\n","content":"\n<h2>75% reduction in tax debt gets this earthmoving company moving again</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time a Melbourne-based earthmoving company contacted Mackay Goodwin over reducing their accrued debt, they had build up a $280,000 backlog with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO). The company, which specialises in earthmoving and concrete for swimming pools, were discussing possible options and drawing a blank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a consultation process, the company agreed with our assertion that the best way to reduce their overall debt was to put themselves into Voluntary Administration. Through us, they appointed an administrator to oversee the division of debts and their repayment in a bipartisan manner, in order to reach an accord that would allow the company to continue functioning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Voluntary Administration consists largely of a 4-5 week moratorium. The company can trade as usual, but the administrator conducts additional reviews and examines the best potential way to pay off as much of their debt as possible, ranging from incremental changes to be applied over time to large-scale restructuring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main issue we determined to be present was that of cash flow, and so when detailing a Deed of Company Arrangement with the ATO, we reached an agreement to pay 25 cents in the dollar over 12 months to allow the company to both resume trading efficiently and allow payback of debts on a fixed timeline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A Deed of Company Arrangement (DOCA) is a legally binding agreement between a company and creditors, created by the bipartisan administrator with the aim of pleasing all parties involved, as well as keeping the insolvent company operating. If this isn’t possible, they at least attempt to keep creditors more secure than if their debtor was wound up. The ATO is historically lenient enough with tax debts to allow exceptions for the purposes of debt reduction over time, but has also been increasingly active in legal proceedings, so a formal accord in the form of a DOCA was a potential best-case scenario for the company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ATO will generally accept these only if it would favour them better than a simple declaration of bankruptcy or liquidation. This usually occurs if the ATO also considers the company historically compliant and the proposal sound, and this criteria was applicable to the company. For this reason, a DOCA was granted by the ATO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On top of the DOCA, Mackay Goodwin worked with the directors to stabilise their business structure, helping with restoring their working capital, and restructuring their business management and cost structures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This involved:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Improving business management – identifying areas where efficiencies could be achieved including ways to reduce costs, grow revenue and improve accounting practices. &nbsp;</li><li>Improving the management of working capital – identifying ways to better manage inventories and accounts payable, and improving accounts receivable processes (i.e. creating an [A/R] ageing report to track and measure the payment status of all customers, offering payment plans and early payment discounts etc).</li><li>Analysing the company’s cost structure – classifying expenses as either fixed or variable in order to better understand the profitability of the business.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The earthmoving company is now trading from strength to strength and the director of the company had nothing but praise for Mackay Goodwin and the Voluntary Administration process. They gave a big thank you to the Mackay Goodwin administration team that assisted with them getting their business back on its feet.</p>\n","slug":"earthmoving-company-case-study","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","mediaItemUrl":"http://growingcolossus.com/mackaygoodwin/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/jr-harris-T72ooC45UTE-unsplash-scaled.jpg"}}}]},"allWpEvent":{"nodes":[{"title":"Real Estate Negotiations in the Covid Environment with Knight Frank","excerpt":"<p>Join James Johnston, Occupier Solutions of Knight Frank and Domenic Calabretta, CEO, Mackay Goodwin on discussing the current issues the real estate industry is facing including negotiating leases due to the current COVID environment.</p>\n","content":"\n<p>Join&nbsp;<strong>James Johnston</strong>, Occupier Solutions of Knight Frank and Domenic<strong>&nbsp;Calabretta</strong>, CEO, Mackay Goodwin on discussing the current issues the real estate industry is facing including negotiating leases&nbsp;due to the current COVID environment.</p>\n","slug":"real-estate-negotiations-in-the-covid-environment-with-knight-frank","featuredImage":{"node":{"altText":"","mediaItemUrl":"http://growingcolossus.com/mackaygoodwin/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Bankruptcy-or-Liquidation-1.jpeg"}},"eventsOption":{"eventDate":"26 October 2021, 11:30am","registerUrl":" https://zoom.us/webinar/register/6216292667550/WN_-zg3o-lqTT-yWyKGREhUWw"}},{"title":"Current State of Environment on a Macro & Micro Level with Macquarie Bank","excerpt":"<p>Join Martin Lakos, Division Director Macquarie Wealth Management, Andrew Knowles, National Segment Head &#8211; Insolvency, Business Banking, Macquarie Bank and Domenic Calabretta, CEO, Mackay Goodwin to discuss the outlook of the Australian economy.</p>\n","content":"\n<p>Join&nbsp;<strong>Martin Lakos</strong>, Division Director Macquarie Wealth Management,&nbsp;<strong>Andrew Knowles</strong>, National Segment Head &#8211; Insolvency, Business Banking, Macquarie Bank and&nbsp;<strong>Domenic Calabretta</strong>, CEO, Mackay Goodwin to discuss the outlook of the Australian economy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;We will:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Look at a global big picture view</li><li>Drilling down to our outlook in Australia</li><li>Looking into interest rates, business and consumer confidence</li><li>Business investment and property</li><li>What&nbsp;macro themes we believe will play out&nbsp;this decade</li></ul>\n","slug":"current-state-of-environment-on-a-macro-micro-level-with-macquarie-bank","featuredImage":{"node":null},"eventsOption":{"eventDate":"6th October, 11:30am","registerUrl":"https://zoom.us/webinar/register/6216292667550/WN_fWcHT8SIQaWxXAQJh1u7fw"}},{"title":"Cyber Crime with James Linton","excerpt":"<p>Join James Linton, Ben Jones, Managing Director of Continuum Cyber and Domenic Calabretta, CEO of Mackay Goodwin as they discuss:</p>\n<p>Importance of cyber education<br />\nWhy Cyber security is necessary<br />\nA CEO’s experience with Cyber Crime</p>\n<p>Attendees will receive the opportunity for a free cyber health check and access to a free eBook on how to secure your business.</p>\n","content":"\n<p>We are excited to launch Mackay Goodwin’s MG Academy, kicking off with our first webinar on Cyber Crime featuring the notorious James Linton aka email prankster.
