For this particular security company, the sheer magnitude of size for the companies of those contracts ultimately led them into incurring significant working capital difficulties, largely formed by insufficiently detailed terms and deliverables combined with timeline blowout, which ultimately formed an unsustainable pattern of loss. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a time, the company declared insolvency. Continued difficulties had led them to be unable to sufficiently contribute their taxes, and they owed over $2 million to unsecured creditors (as well as almost $400,000 in employee entitlements, including annual leave payments and outstanding employee superannuation contributions). This, in turn, led to suppliers refusing to provide credit, which forced them deeper into financial difficulties.</p>\n","featuredImage":null,"metaFields":{"metaDescription":null,"metaTitle":null}},"allWp":{"nodes":[{"themeGeneralSettings":{"themeGeneralSettings":{"copyrightText":"Â© 2021 All rights reserved | Mackay Goodwin Corporate Restructuring and Advisory","expertAdviceLink":"https://www.google.com","expertAdviceTitle":"Get expert advice","fieldGroupName":"themeGeneralSettings","getInTouchDescription":"Speak to one of our experts now for a free consultation.<br/>Enter your details below or call 0292207100.","getInTouchTitle":"Get in touch","speakExpertLink":"tel: 1300750599","speakExpertTitle":"Speak to our experts 0292207100"}}}]}},"pageContext":{"id":"cG9zdDozNjc="}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864","63159454"]}
